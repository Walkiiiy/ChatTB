You are given three inputs:

1. **Text Question:** A natural language query from the user.
2. **Correct SQL:** The ground-truth SQL query.
3. **Wrong SQL:** The incorrect SQL query.

### Task

Your job is to compare the **Wrong SQL** with the **Correct SQL** and the **Text Question**, and produce a **detailed list of reasons why the Wrong SQL failed**.

### Guidelines for Failure Analysis

When listing reasons, be as **specific and schema-aware** as possible. Common failure categories include:

1. **Ambiguity in User Question**

   * The question may use vague terms without specifying keywords such as column, table names or metric.
   * The question may omit schema-specific details (e.g., “students” could map to multiple tables: `students`, `student_records`, `enrollments`).

2. **Table-Level Errors**

   * Wrong table chosen due to similar naming (e.g., `orders` vs. `order_items`).
   * Missing necessary table (e.g., forgot to join `departments` when asking about “department names”).

3. **Join-Related Errors**

   * Missing a join condition (causing Cartesian product).
   * Incorrect foreign key usage (e.g., joining `teacher_id` to `student_id`).
   * Used an indirect join when a direct join was required.

4. **Column-Level Errors**

   * Selected wrong column due to similar names (e.g., `name` in `students` vs. `name` in `teachers`).
   * Chose an attribute from the wrong table.
   * Ignored composite keys or multi-part identifiers.

5. **Aggregation & Grouping Errors**

   * Misapplied aggregation (e.g., `COUNT(DISTINCT student_id)` vs. `COUNT(student_id)`).
   * Grouped on the wrong field.
   * Forgot necessary `HAVING` condition.

6. **Filtering Errors (`WHERE` Conditions)**

   * Wrong filter applied (e.g., filtering `year` instead of `semester`).
   * Misinterpreted natural language constraints (e.g., “students older than 20” vs. “students enrolled after 2020”).

7. **Ordering / Limiting Errors**

   * Sorted by the wrong column (e.g., ordering by `student_id` instead of `score`).
   * Used `LIMIT 1` when multiple results were expected.

8. **Schema-Specific Traps**

   * **Polymorphic columns**: Column names like `id`, `name`, `date` appear in multiple tables, causing confusion.
   * **Indirect attributes**: Attribute not stored in the main table but requires lookup (e.g., “course name” is in `courses`, not `enrollments`).
   * **Surrogate vs. natural keys**: Query mistakenly uses surrogate keys (like `course_id`) when the question expects natural keys (like `course_name`).
   * **Denormalization traps**: Same information is available in multiple tables, but only one is authoritative.

### Expected Output

Provide a structured **list of reasons** why the Wrong SQL failed, referencing both the schema and the text question when possible. Be concrete and precise (e.g., “Used `teacher.name` instead of `student.name` because both columns exist in the schema” instead of “wrong column”).
the question:
"question": "List the top five schools, by descending order, from the highest to the lowest, the most number of Enrollment (Ages 5-17). Please give their NCES school identification number.",
the correct sql:
"ground_truth": "SELECT T1.NCESSchool FROM schools AS T1 INNER JOIN frpm AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode ORDER BY T2.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` DESC LIMIT 5",
the wrong sql:
"sql": "SELECT s.NCESSchool, f.\"Enrollment (Ages 5-17)\"\nFROM frpm f\nJOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode\nORDER BY f.\"Enrollment (Ages 5-17)\" DESC\nLIMIT 5;",






Here’s a **failure analysis** comparing the **Wrong SQL** against the **Correct SQL** and the **Text Question**:

---

### 1. **Extra Column Selected**

* **Text Question:** Asks only for the **NCES school identification number** of the top five schools.
* **Correct SQL:** Returns only `T1.NCESSchool`.
* **Wrong SQL:** Returns both `s.NCESSchool` **and** `f."Enrollment (Ages 5-17)"`.
* **Error:** The inclusion of the enrollment count column is unnecessary and not requested in the question.

---

### 2. **Misinterpretation of Required Output**

* **Text Question:** Explicitly says “Please give their NCES school identification number.”
* **Correct SQL:** Focuses only on that identifier.
* **Wrong SQL:** Adds extra data (the enrollment numbers), which violates the requirement.

---

### 3. **No True Semantic Error in Table Usage or Joins**

* **Table-Level Check:** Both queries correctly join `schools` and `frpm` on `CDSCode`.
* **Join Integrity:** The join condition is correct (`CDSCode` ↔ `CDSCode`), so no Cartesian product or mis-join issue exists.

---

### 4. **Aggregation Not Needed (and Correctly Not Used)**

* The question does **not** ask for grouped aggregation (e.g., totals per school), but simply to sort by the enrollment column.
* Both queries avoid unnecessary aggregation, so no error here.

---

### 5. **Ordering and Limiting**

* Both queries correctly order by `"Enrollment (Ages 5-17)"` descending and limit to 5.
* No error in ordering/limiting logic.

---

## ✅ **Summary of Errors in Wrong SQL**

1. **Unnecessary Column Selection:** Wrong SQL outputs both school ID and enrollment values, whereas the question requires only the NCES school ID.
2. **Output Specification Error:** By including extra data, the wrong SQL fails to precisely match the user’s intent.

Would you like me to also produce a **generalized rubric/checklist** (like a reusable template) that could be applied to *any pair of SQLs* for failure analysis, or do you want me to keep the analysis case-specific like I did here?
