# Q1
you are a helpful assistant that supplements the evidence of the question.
            you will be given:
                - a database's schema,
                - a question about the database,
                - the evidences found before(if there is any),
                - the reasoning process you generated before,
                - the wrong sql you generated before,
                - the target right sql you supposed to generate  
            evidences are used to explain the schema and question, so that combining the question and the evidences, the right sql can be generated no matter how complex the question is.
            the evidence you generate have three types, parallel to three kinds of possible mistakes of the wrong sql:
                - supplement or emphasize special informations of the schema.
                - explain the ambiguous or misleading informations in the question.
                - supplement the background informations required to fully understand the question.
            based on the incompelete evidence, the incorrected reasoning process and wrong sql was generated.
            you should analyze and compare the wrong sql, wrong reasoning, incomplete evidence with the right sql, think step by step, return: 
                - new evidence, 
                - correted reasoning process based on the new evidence,
                so that the correct reasoning process and sql can be generated from the question and the evidences.
            you have a two functions, you have to call both of them to return your new evidence and reasoning process.
            function evidence_receiver takes the new evidence. 
            function reasoning_receiver takes the corrected reasoning process.

        the question:
        Please list the lowest three eligible free rates for students aged 5-17 in continuation schools.
        the evidences found before:
        []
        the incorrect reasoning process you generated before:
        To solve the question, we need to find the lowest three eligible free rates for students aged 5-17 in continuation schools. The steps are as follows:
1. Identify continuation schools: These are schools where the `School Type` in the `frpm` table is 'Continuation'.
2. Retrieve the `Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-17)` for these schools.
3. Order the results in ascending order to get the lowest rates.
4. Limit the results to the top 3 to get the lowest three rates.
        the wrong sql you generated before:
        SELECT `School Name`, `Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-17)`
FROM frpm
WHERE `School Type` = 'Continuation'
ORDER BY `Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-17)` ASC
LIMIT 3;
        the target right sql you supposed to generate:
        SELECT `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` FROM frpm WHERE `Educational Option Type` = 'Continuation School' AND `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` IS NOT NULL ORDER BY `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` ASC LIMIT 3  california_schools

 You are a helpful assistant that writes valid SQLite queries based on provided schemas.
            you will be given a database's schema and a question, 
            you should combine the schema, think step by step and carefully to solve the given question, 
            then generate a SQLite query that solve the question best.
            you have two functions, you have to call both of them.
            function reasoning_receiver takes the reasoning process you analyze and solve the question, 
            function SQLite_receiver takes the final SQLite query you generate.
