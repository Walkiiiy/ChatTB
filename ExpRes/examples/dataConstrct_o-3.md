The **California Schools Database** contains data on various educational institutions across California, including details about the schools, districts, and related characteristics. This database appears to focus on the operations, performance, and demographic attributes of public schools, including their academic performance, enrollment statistics, and administrative details. The data is divided into several tables that categorize information regarding school performance, school and district details, and other aspects such as funding and grade levels.
