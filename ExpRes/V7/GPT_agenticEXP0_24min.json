It contains financial records of about 5,300 clients, roughly one million transactions, around 700 approved loans and approximately 900 credit cards【570489046690532†L31-L55】.  These tables capture different facets of the bank’s operations: clients and their accounts, the dispositions connecting clients to accounts, approved loans, credit cards, payment orders, individual transactions and demographic data for each district.  Each account has static characteristics stored in the account table and dynamic information recorded in orders and transactions, while the client table identifies people who may own or use accounts.  The disposition table links clients to accounts and indicates whether a person is an owner or only an authorised user (disponent)【570489046690532†L42-L56】.  Loan and card tables describe banking services offered, and the district table contains publicly available demographic information such as number of inhabitants, municipalities, unemployment rates and crime counts【650276726694361†L26-L42】.  Understanding this schema requires translating the coded values (e.g., transaction types, operation modes, k_symbol codes, account frequency codes, loan status codes and regional names) from Czech to English, hence the background research recorded below.",
