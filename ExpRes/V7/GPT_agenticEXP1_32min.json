  "document": "The thrombosis_prediction database contains three tables—Laboratory.csv, Patient.csv and Examination.csv—that collectively record clinical information about patients with autoimmune disorders who may develop thrombosis.  \n• The database appears to come from a Japanese rheumatology cohort focusing on antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and related autoimmune diseases.  APS is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by persistent antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin and anti‑β2‑glycoprotein I antibodies) that predispose patients to vascular thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity【463883795593023†L95-L103】.  Patients with APS often have overlapping diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), Sjögren’s syndrome (SJS) and systemic sclerosis.  \n• The Laboratory table stores chronological blood and urine test results (e.g., liver enzymes, kidney function, blood counts, coagulation factors, thrombosis markers, complement levels and autoantibody titers) for each patient visit.  These measurements include aspartate transaminase (GOT/AST), alanine aminotransferase (GPT/ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total protein and albumin, uric acid, urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin, cholesterol and triglycerides, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), blood glucose, white/red blood cell counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet counts, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FG), plasmin‑α2‑antiplasmin inhibitor complex (PIC) and thrombin–antithrombin complex (TAT), immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, IgM), C‑reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (RA and RF), complement components C3/C4, and a panel of extractable nuclear antigens (anti‑RNP, anti‑SM, anti‑Scl‑70/SC170, anti‑SSA/Ro, anti‑SSB/La, anti‑centromere) and anti‑DNA antibodies.  \n• The Patient table records demographic information (ID, sex, birthdate) and diagnostic labels.  Diagnoses include hypergammaglobulinemia (polyclonal gammopathy—a state where white blood cells produce excessive immunoglobulins【381624033923008†L41-L44】, often associated with infection or autoimmune disease【381624033923008†L88-L92】), MCTD (mixed connective tissue disease characterized by anti‑U1‑RNP antibodies and overlapping features of lupus, systemic sclerosis and myositis), autoimmune leukopenia (low leukocyte count due to immune‑mediated destruction of white blood cells【790424262088281†L185-L190】), SLE and APS suspicion, Sjögren’s syndrome (autoimmune destruction of salivary and lacrimal glands causing dry eyes and dry mouth【188665771501971†L159-L168】), progressive systemic sclerosis (systemic scleroderma—a fibrosing autoimmune disease with excess collagen affecting skin and internal organs【971055777559727†L157-L166】), polymyositis (chronic inflammatory myopathy causing muscle weakness【768301945346488†L156-L170】), ulcerative colitis (an inflammatory bowel disease affecting the colon and rectum【572860270908966†L83-L87】【572860270908966†L109-L121】) and seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (patients have RA symptoms but lack rheumatoid factor and anti‑CCP antibodies【652077013928385†L142-L160】).  \n• The Examination table contains values of antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin IgG/IgM/IgA), antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers and patterns, results of lupus anticoagulant tests (kaolin clotting time [KCT], dilute Russell’s viper venom time [dRVVT] and lupus anticoagulant [LAC]) and a thrombosis severity score.  ANA pattern codes (P=peripheral, D=diffuse/homogeneous, S=speckled, N=nucleolar) help clinicians decide which autoantibody tests to perform【729433811950850†L388-L397】.  KCT is a sensitive clotting test for lupus anticoagulant【243067386400291†L123-L130】, dRVVT uses snake venom to detect lupus anticoagulant【834496446144828†L122-L176】, and TAT and PIC indicate coagulation and fibrinolysis activation【218076285194957†L115-L125】【229300190390687†L292-L297】.  The thrombosis field encodes categories (0–3); grade‑1 thrombosis corresponds to venous thrombosis, grade‑2 denotes deep venous thrombosis requiring intervention, and grade‑3 indicates more serious events such as pulmonary embolism or arterial thrombosis, with grade‑0 signifying no thrombosis【408973477631262†L2-L10】.  Symptoms recorded include venous leg ulcers (wounds near the ankle due to venous insufficiency【79371501122168†L65-L87】), renal artery thrombosis (rare but serious obstruction of renal artery causing renal infarction【631764142013844†L127-L133】), cerebral (brain) infarction (ischemic stroke due to thrombotic or embolic occlusion of cerebral vessels【956058483496076†L155-L162】), pregnancy loss (abortion—induced termination or spontaneous miscarriage【58167333794246†L84-L93】) and multiple thrombosis events.  \nTogether, these tables provide a comprehensive view of autoimmune patients’ lab profiles, diagnoses and outcomes, enabling researchers to study how various biomarkers and autoantibody patterns relate to thrombosis risk and to develop predictive models.",
