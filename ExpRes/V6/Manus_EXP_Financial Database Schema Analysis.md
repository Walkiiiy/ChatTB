# Financial Database Schema Analysis

## Overview
This is a financial database containing transaction and banking data. Based on the schema analysis, I need to identify terms and concepts that require web search for complete understanding.

## Initial Analysis

### Database Structure
- **Database Name**: "financial"
- **Tables**: 
  - trans.csv (transactions)
  - disp.csv (dispositions)
  - loan.csv (loans)
  - card.csv (cards)

### Key Observations

#### Czech Banking Terms
The database contains several Czech banking terms that need clarification:

1. **Transaction Types (column3 in trans.csv)**:
   - "PRIJEM" - credit
   - "VYDAJ" - withdrawal
   - "VYBER" - appears in samples but not defined

2. **Operation Types (column4 in trans.csv)**:
   - "VYBER KARTOU" - credit card withdrawal
   - "VKLAD" - credit in cash
   - "PREVOD Z UCTU" - collection from another bank
   - "VYBER" - withdrawal in cash
   - "PREVOD NA UCET" - remittance to another bank

3. **Transaction Characterization (k_symbol in trans.csv)**:
   - "POJISTNE" - insurance payment
   - "SLUZBY" - payment for statement
   - "UROK" - interest credited
   - "SANKC. UROK" - sanction interest if negative balance
   - "SIPO" - household
   - "DUCHOD" - old-age pension
   - "UVER" - loan payment

4. **Disposition Types (column3 in disp.csv)**:
   - "OWNER"
   - "DISPONENT" - needs clarification

## Terms Requiring Web Search

Based on the analysis, I need to search for:
1. Czech banking terminology context
2. Specific meaning of "DISPONENT" in banking
3. Understanding of Czech banking system structure



## Web Search Results

### DISPONENT in Banking
- **Definition**: In banking, a "disponent" (or "disponent bankovního účtu" in Czech) refers to an authorized user or authorized person who has access to a bank account held in another's name. This individual can authorize transactions on that account, but typically does not have the right to amend the account itself (e.g., change account terms or apply for loans).
- **Context in Schema**: In `disp.csv`, the `type` column with values "OWNER" and "DISPONENT" indicates whether the entry refers to the primary account holder or an authorized user.

### Czech Banking Terminology
- **"VYBER"**: While "PRIJEM" (credit) and "VYDAJ" (withdrawal) were defined, "VYBER" was not. Based on the search results and context, "VYBER" also means **withdrawal**, often specifically a cash withdrawal.
- **Other terms**: The provided `valueDescription` for `operation` and `k_symbol` columns in `trans.csv` already provided good translations for most terms. The search confirmed these translations and provided additional context for some, such as "SIPO" referring to household payments.

## Updated Understanding

The database schema is for a financial institution, likely a bank in the Czech Republic, given the terminology. It tracks customer accounts, transactions, loan details, and card information. The relationships between tables can be inferred:
- `trans.csv` (transactions) and `disp.csv` (dispositions) are linked by `account_id`.
- `loan.csv` (loans) is linked to `account_id`.
- `card.csv` (cards) is likely linked to `disp_id` or `client_id` (need to confirm with full schema).

All previously ambiguous terms are now clarified. No further web searches are immediately necessary based on the provided schema snippet.
