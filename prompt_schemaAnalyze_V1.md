  - what every table is about? what every column stands for?
  - what is every column's purpose in describing the whole schema?
  - in what form or unit is every column's value described?
  - how are the columns and tables linked or related?
- you will be given a database schema, which contains brief description of column in the tables. 
- the schema describes the database with every table's every column's origin column name, full column name, column description(brief), dataformat, size, number of empty values, type(continuous data or discrete genre), samples, average value, max and minimum value, and mathmatical varience.
- however, some of the abbre and uncommon column names and values are still hard to understand. for in real world databases, lots of column names and genre typed values are Abbreviations and uncommon words, and the description in the schema is not specific enough, causing the misunderstand in the schema, leading to wrong analyze outcomes.
