Created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky,[2][3] it is the flagship site of the Stack Exchange Network.[4][5][6] Stack Overflow features questions and answers on certain computer programming topics,[7][8][9] and was created to be a more open alternative to earlier question-and-answer websites such as Experts-Exchange. The website was sold to Prosus, a Netherlands-based consumer-internet conglomerate, on 2 June 2021 for $1.8 billion.[10]\nStack Overflow serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions, and, through membership and active participation, to vote questions and answers up or down similar to Reddit and edit questions and answers in a fashion similar to a wiki.[11] Users of the website can earn reputation points and \"badges\"; for example, a person is awarded 10 reputation points for receiving an \"up\" vote on a question or an answer to a question,[12] and can receive badges for their valued contributions,[13] which represents a gamification of the traditional Q&A website. Users unlock new privileges with an increase in reputation like the ability to vote, comment, and even edit other people's posts.[14]\nAs of June 2025, Stack Overflow has over 29 million registered users, and has received over 24 million questions and 36 million answers.[15] The site and similar programming question-and-answer sites have globally mostly replaced programming books for day-to-day programming reference in the 2000s, and today are an important part of computer programming.[16] Based on the type of tags assigned to questions, the top eight most-discussed topics on the site are JavaScript, Java, C#, PHP, Android, Python, jQuery, and HTML.[17]\nThe website was created by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky in 2008.[2] The name for the website was chosen by voting in April 2008 by readers of Coding Horror, Atwood's programming blog.[18] On 31 July 2008, Jeff Atwood sent out invitations encouraging his subscribers to take part in the private beta of the new website, limiting its use to those willing to test out the new software. On 15 September 2008 it was announced that the public beta version was in session and that the general public was now able to use it to seek assistance on programming related issues. The design of the Stack Overflow logo was decided by a voting process.[19]\nOn 3 May 2010, it was announced that Stack Overflow had raised $6 million in venture capital from a group of investors led by Union Square Ventures.[20]\nIn 2019, Stack Overflow named Prashanth Chandrasekar as its chief executive officer and Teresa Dietrich as its chief product officer.[21]\nIn June 2021, Prosus, a Netherlands-based subsidiary of South African media company Naspers, announced a deal to acquire Stack Overflow for $1.8 billion.[22]\nIn early May 2019, an update was deployed to Stack Overflow's development version. It contained a bug which allowed an attacker to grant themselves privileges in accessing the production version of the site. Stack Overflow published on their blog that approximately 184 public network users were affected by this breach, which \"could have returned IP address, names, or emails\".[23][24]\nIn mid-2023, Stack Exchange made several changes regarding its policies around content generated by artificial intelligence which resulted in a strike of a portion of its volunteer moderators. The protest centered around a policy posted to moderators on May 29 stating that the use of AI-detection tools were not permitted to be used as part of moderation. In a statement, Stack Exchange confirmed that 11% of moderators had ceased content moderation in response to this policy.[25] This would grow to more than 23% of all moderators on the network by June 22, including more than 70% of all Stack Overflow moderators.[26]\nThe strike began with a post to Meta Stack Exchange, which raised concerns regarding the quality and accuracy of AI-generated content, and the lack of transparency from Stack Exchange surrounding this policy change.[27] Moderators also stated that the version of the policy released to the public differed from the version they had received on the moderator-only forum, notably in that the public version did not include language requiring that moderators stop restricting all AI content.[28]\nStack Overflow only accepts questions about programming that are tightly focused on a specific problem. Questions of a broader nature\u2014or those inviting answers that are inherently a matter of opinion\u2014are usually rejected by the site's users, and marked as closed. The sister site softwareengineering.stackexchange.com is intended to be a venue for broader queries, e.g. general questions about software development.[30]\nClosing questions is a main differentiation from other Q&A sites like Yahoo! Answers and a way to prevent low quality questions. The mechanism was overhauled in 2013; questions edited after being put \"on hold\" now appear in a review queue.[31] Jeff Atwood stated in 2010 that duplicate questions are not seen as a problem but rather they constitute an advantage if such additional questions drive extra traffic to the site by multiplying relevant keyword hits in search engines.[32]\nAll user-generated content is licensed under Creative Commons Attribute-ShareAlike license, version 2.5, 3.0, or 4.0 depending on the date the content was contributed.[33]\nA 2013 study has found that 75% of users only ask one question, 65% only answer one question, and only 8% of users answer more than 5 questions.[34] To empower a wider group of users to ask questions and then answer, Stack Overflow created a mentorship program resulting in users having a 50% increase in score on average.[35] As of 2011, 92% of the questions were answered, in a median time of 11 minutes.[36]\nAs of August 2012, 443,000 of the 1.3 million registered users had answered at least one question, and of those, approximately 6,000 (0.46% of the total user count) had earned a reputation score greater than 5000.[37] Reputation can be gained fastest by answering questions related to tags with lower expertise density, doing so promptly (in particular being the first one to answer a question), being active during off-peak hours, and contributing to diverse areas.[37]\nStack Overflow is written in C# using the ASP.NET MVC (Model\u2013View\u2013Controller) framework, and Microsoft SQL Server for the database[38] and the Dapper object-relational mapper used for data access.[39] Unregistered users have access to most of the site's functionality, while users who sign in can gain access to more functionality, such as asking or answering a question, establishing a profile and being able to earn reputation to allow functionality like editing questions and answers without peer review or voting to close a question.[40]\nStack Overflow won the 2020 Webby People's Voice Award for Community in the category Web.[41]\nThe site's culture has been criticized in the past for being unfriendly by one research paper, especially in the context of gender differences in participation and beginners learning computer science.[42] A 2023 study by another researcher concluded that the website's new users were met with significant difficulties in obtaining help from other users in posts started by the former; an analysis from a sample of 968 posts showed that 49% experienced hurdles such as their questions being closed, receiving no response, or receiving no mention as to why their posts were being negatively scored.[43]\nA study from the University of Maryland found that Android developers that used only Stack Overflow as their programming resource tended to write less secure code than those who used only the official Android developer documentation from Google, while developers using only the official Android documentation tended to write significantly less functional code than those who used only Stack Overflow.[44]\nStarting from 2023 and as of July 2025, Stack Overflow's questions have rapidly decreased due to AI-enabled solutions like ChatGPT, Deepseek and Claude AI.[45]\nDonate\nCreate account\nLog in\nArticle\nTalk\nRead\nEdit\nView history\nEnglishSpanishRussianPortugueseJapanese\nCC BY-SA 2.5 (until April 2011)\nCC BY-SA 3.0 (until May 2018)\nCC BY-SA 4.0\nInternet portal\nAskbot (free engine)\nList of Internet forums\nRosetta Code (multi-lingual algorithms)\nOfficial website\nComputing websitesGamificationInternet properties established in 2008Question-and-answer websitesSoftware developer communitiesStack Exchange network2021 mergers and acquisitions\nThis page was last edited on 23 July 2025, at 01:13 (UTC).\nText is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License; additional terms may apply.

Younger (under 18) respondents rely most on online resources and are most likely to have learned from online courses or certifications.\nLast year we saw Git as a fundamental tool to being a developer. This year it appears that Docker is becoming a similar fundamental tool for Professional Developers, increasing from 55% to 69%.\nPeople learning to code are more likely to be using 3D tools than Professional Developers - Unity 3D (23% vs 8%) and Unreal Engine (9% vs 3%) - teaching themselves skills for 3D VR and AR.\nRust is on its seventh year as the most loved language with 87% of developers saying they want to continue using it.\nRust also ties with Python as the most wanted technology with TypeScript running a close second.\nPhoenix overtakes Svelte\u2019s spot as the most loved web framework.\nAngular.js is in its third year as the most dreaded. React.js completes its fifth year as most wanted.\nDocker and Kubernetes are in first and second place as the most loved and wanted tools.\nThe desire to start using Docker does not appear to be slowing down as Docker increased from 30% last to 37% this year for wanted.\nClojure remains the highest-paid language to know. Chef developers are the highest paid but Chef is also the most dreaded other tool.\nBig-data and data streaming skills are well compensated with Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, and Hadoop all in the top three other frameworks and libraries.\nAdditionally, developers that have colocation experience are paid more than their cloud-only counterparts.\nFull-time employment went up by 4 percentage points for all respondents. Professional Developers that are \u201cIndependent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed\u201d have grown significantly in the last year (up by 5 percentage points).\nIn 2022 this question was changed to multi-select.\n85% of developers say their organizations are at least partially remote.\nSmaller organizations are most likely to be in-person, with 20% of 2-19 employee organizations in-person.\nThe largest organizations, with 10k+ employees, are most likely to be hybrid.\n62% of all respondents spend more than 30 minutes a day searching for answers or solutions to problems.\n25% spending more than an hour each day. Regardless of being an independent contributor or people manager, this is time that could be spent learning or building.\nFor a team of 50 developers, the amount of time spent searching for answers/solutions adds up to between 333-651 hours of time lost per week across the entire team.\nWhat we know about the global community of developers\nDeveloper Profile\nMost developers (87%) have a post-secondary education, having some college or more.\n38% of those learning to code already have a degree, learning doesn\u2019t have to stop after you graduate.\n70% of all respondents and 80% of Professional Developers have completed some form of higher education, a bachelor\u2019s degree being the most common.\nDeveloper Profile\nWe see that learning how to code is a very unique experience, with people using a variety of tools and resources to build their skills.\nLearning to code online increased from 60% to 70% year over year.\nRespondents older than 45 years are most likely to have learned from books, while younger ones are learning online. Younger (under 18) respondents rely most on online resources and are most likely to have learned from online courses or certifications.\nThe most relied upon online resources for people to learn how to code are technical documentation and Stack Overflow. This shows how important it is for companies to have well-written documentation available and an active community providing answers on Stack Overflow.\nIt\u2019s also interesting that we see such variety in the way that people teach themselves how to code. Written material, a variety of video formats, books, courses - there\u2019s no one size fits all approach to learning how to code. Everyone can piece together the resources and formats that work best for their learning style.\nUdemy leads as the most popular online course or certification program for learning how to code. This may be popular for the same reasons we saw above - people can purchase the individual courses they want, creating their own learning path.\nDeveloper Profile\nThe majority of developers in their early to mid-career stage.\nSimilar to last year 50% of respondents have been coding for ten years or less.\nThe United States and United Kingdom respondents are the most experienced respondents, with an average of 15 and a half years of experience coding.\nA majority of respondents (75%) have been working for 14 or fewer years as a professional developer, meaning they\u2019ve never worked in a world without Stack Overflow.\nYears of professional coding experience by developer type\nDeveloper Profile\nFew developers consider themselves to be a single developer type, showing us their skill diversity.\nFull-stack, back-end, front-end, and desktop developers continue to account for the majority of all respondents. We asked about Cloud infrastructure engineer for the first time this year - almost 9% classify themselves as this type of developer.\nDevelopers are wearing multiple hats. The majority of respondents said they considered themselves to be more than one type of developer - with DBAs, SREs, and Security professionals reporting the most variety. On average each of these roles reported being seven other developer types.\nDeveloper Profile\nAcross the world, developers and technologists turn to Stack Overflow to gain and share knowledge. Our survey received responses from almost every country on Earth.\nThe United States and India continue to provide the highest volume of survey responses, followed by Germany and UKI (UK and Ireland).\nThe top ten countries account for almost 60% of all respondents. This year we saw Spain just barely overtake Italy for the number ten spot. To see the top ten countries, refer to the methodology section.\nDeveloper Profile\nDevelopers and technologists are a diverse group of individuals across many spectrums. We are committed to continuing to ensure our platform is inclusive and welcoming to all.\n46% of Professional Developers are 25-34 years old. But we see that more than half of the respondents learning to code are 18-24 years old.\nThose learning to code are slightly less likely to identify as a man and slightly more likely to prefer to not identify. Both of these are indications that the industry (and our survey) could continue to become more diverse as more people join the workforce.\n92% of all respondents and 93% of Professional Developers identify as a man. The United States has the highest percentage of gender minorities (Woman, Non-binary, genderqueer, or gender non-conforming). We have considerable work to do to ensure our platform is inclusive and that our survey is representative of developers everywhere.\n1.5% of all respondents identify as transgender. Like we see with gender identification, those learning to code are slightly more likely to prefer to not say if they identify as transgender.\nThose learning to code are less likely to identify as straight/heterosexual than Professional Developers, with 10% preferring not to say.\nThose learning to code are less likely to identify as European and/or White than Professional Developers. Like we saw with other demographic questions, the new group of developers who may enter the workforce soon, could be more diverse.\n2,547 respondents have a physical difference, with the majority of these respondents being blind or having difficulty seeing.\nResponse to this question increased from 20% last year to 22% this year.\nThis year we see more developers identifying as having a concentration and/or memory disorder (10.6%), anxiety disorder (10.3%), mood or emotional disorder (9.7%).\nEach year we explore the tools and technologies developers are currently using and what they want to use.\nWe have the favorite Loved, Dreaded, and Wanted data as well as Worked With vs. Want to Work With, which shows us precisely what developers used in the past year and what they want to work on in the following year. If you need a refresher on how we structure Loved, Dread and Wanted, or if you want to read about the intuition behind Worked With vs. Want to Work With, check out this post our meta post.\nTechnology\nThis year, we're comparing the popular technologies across three different groups: All respondents, Professional Developers, and those that are learning to code.\n2022 marks JavaScript\u2019s tenth year in a row as the most commonly used programming language.\nBut, it\u2019s a different picture for those learning to code. HTML/CSS, Javascript and Python are almost tied as the most popular languages for people learning to code. People learning to code are more likely than Professional Developers to report using Python (58% vs 44%), C++ (35% vs 20%), and C (32% vs 17%).\nCompared to Professional Developers, those learning to code are less likely to report using SQL (38% vs 53%), TypeScript (15% vs 40%), and Bash/Shell (19% vs 29%).\nFor Professional Developers PostgreSQL just barely took over the first place spot from MySQL. Professional Developers are more likely than those learning to code to use Redis, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Elasticsearch.\nMongoDB is used by a similar percentage of both Professional Developers and those learning to code and it\u2019s the second most popular database for those learning to code (behind MySQL). This makes sense since it supports a large number of languages and application development platforms.\nAWS remains the most used cloud platform for all respondents and for Professional Developers. Azure took the second-place spot from Google Cloud.\nPeople learning to code have much different usage of cloud platforms. Heroku is the most used platform for those learning to code (35%), significantly higher than Professional Developers (18%). We see similar differences with Google Cloud (31% learning to code; 26% Professional Developers), Firebase (30% learning to code; 21% Professional Developers), VMware (12% learning to code; 8% Professional Developers).\nYou can see the inroads that AWS and Azure have with organizations - significantly more Professional Developers are using those platforms compared to people who are learning to code.\nNode.js and React.js are the two most common web technologies used by Professional Developers and those learning to code. Angular is used more by Professional Developers than those learning to code (23% vs 10%), same with ASP.NET (16% vs 10%) and ASP.NET Core (21% vs 10%).\nThis year we added additional responses to see the most popular libraries in different domains. For example, TensorFlow remains more popular than PyTorch for machine learning but Scikit-learn is close behind TensorFlow. Flutter and React Native are the two most popular cross-platform tools.\nPeople learning to code are more likely than Professional Developer to be using NumPy (43% vs 24%), Pandas (35% vs 22%) - this makes sense given that they are both Python based and people learning to code are using Python. They are also more likely to be using TensorFlow (18% vs 11%) and Scikit-learn (17% vs 11%).\nLast year we saw Git as a fundamental tool to being a developer. This year it appears that Docker is becoming a similar fundamental tool for Professional Developers, increasing from 55% to 69%.\nPeople learning to code are more likely to be using 3D tools than Professional Developers - Unity 3D (23% vs 8%) and Unreal Engine (9% vs 3%) - teaching themselves skills for 3D VR and AR.\nVisual Studio Code remains the preferred IDE across all developers. PyCharm is used more by people learning to code (26% vs 16%) while Vim is used more by Professional Developers (24% vs 16%).\nWe see definite differences between Professional Developers and people learning to code when it comes to asynchronous work tools. Jira is most used by Professional Developers (49%) but only used by 15% of those learning to code. It\u2019s a similar story with Confluence, the second most used tool by Professional Developers (43%) but only used by 8% of those learning to code. For people starting their career, few of them will have experience with these tools, potentially increasing their time to ramp up on how to use them.\nOn the flip side, people who are learning to code are using Notion (36% vs 19%) and Trello (43% vs 32%) as their asynchronous work tools.\nThe three most popular synchronous tools are universal across all respondents, Professional Developers, and people learning to code - Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Slack.\nFor Professional Developers, the percentage of people using each of these tools is close - between 54%-58% of respondents. However, for people learning to code, Zoom is used significantly more (67%) than Microsoft Teams (48%) and Slack (30%).\nWindows is the most popular operating system for developers, across both personal and professional use. A Linux-based OS is more popular than macOS - speaking to the appeal of using open source software.\nTechnology\nAlways one of the most popular series, we have some technologies/tools that are maintaining their position as most loved (Rust), and some that have unseated leaders (PostgreSQL).\nRust is on its seventh year as the most loved language with 87% of developers saying they want to continue using it.\nRust also ties with Python as the most wanted technology with TypeScript running a close second.\nPostgreSQL becomes the most loved and wanted database after five years of Redis being the most loved.\nAWS remains not only the most used cloud platform but also the most loved and wanted.\nPhoenix overtakes Svelte\u2019s spot as the most loved web framework.\nAngular.js is in its third year as the most dreaded. React.js completes its fifth year as most wanted.\nHugging Face Transformers surfaces as the most loved library while Tensorflow remains the most wanted.\nThis suggests that developers want to build machine learning models but enjoy using pre-trained models more. The popular cross-platform libraries, Flutter and React Native also remain in the top three most wanted.\nDocker and Kubernetes are in first and second place as the most loved and wanted tools.\nThe desire to start using Docker does not appear to be slowing down as Docker increased from 30% last to 37% this year for wanted.\nNeovim is the most loved editor for the second year in a row, with Visual Studio Code the next most loved.\nHowever, Visual Studio Code is the most wanted tool, followed by Android Studio.\nNotion is the most loved asynchronous collaboration tool and the third most wanted tool.\nJira and Confluence - the two most used tools by Professional Developers, are almost evenly split between being loved and dreaded. But Jira is the most wanted tool, followed by Trello, Notion, and Stack Overflow for Teams.\nSlack is the most loved synchronous collaboration tool and the most wanted tool. Zoom, one of the most used tools by Professional Developers, is almost evenly split between being loved and being dreaded.\nTechnology\nDevelopers are naturally curious and interested in new technologies. We look at what technologies they are interested in trying based on what they are using now.\nSimilar to last year we see over 10k Javascript developers that want to start or continue developing in Go or Rust.\nMinimum 5,000 respondents per connection.\nThose learning to code that currently use MySQL are more likely to want to start or continue to use MongoDB over any other database.\nMinimum 5,000 respondents per connection.\nSimilar to 2021, we see a large number of AWS developers wanting to develop in Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure next year.\nProfessional developers are curious about the other cloud platforms that they haven\u2019t worked with before. Each platform offers something slightly different for developers, whether it\u2019s features (e.g., advanced data analytics tools), scalability, pricing options, etc. that can make it appealing to build on.\nMinimum 1,000 respondents per connection.\nReact.js developers are very interconnected with other frameworks and technologies, most notably Node.js.\nMinimum 4,000 respondents per connection.\nNumPy and Pandas are the most interconnected other frameworks/libraries for all respondents, Professional Developers, and those learning to code.\nMinimum 1,000 respondents per connection.\nSimilar to 2021, we see a lot of people working with npm and Docker who also want to work with those same technologies.\nMinimum 5,000 respondents per connection.\nVS Code is the most interconnected IDE among all respondents, Professional Developers, and those learning to code.\nPeople who are learning to code have more IDEs they want to work with - IPython/Jupyter, Eclipse, Atom - than Professional Developers.\nMinimum 5,000 respondents per connection.\nJira and Confluence are most closely interconnected, which makes sense given they are under the same company.\nWe see interest in working with other asynchronous tools, likely because each of these tools serves a different purpose in a developer\u2019s workflow.\nMinimum 1,000 respondents per connection.\nWith Professional Developers, we see some interest in wanting to use other chat and video platforms than they are using now.\nMinimum 1,000 respondents per connection.\nTechnology\nClojure remains the highest-paid language to know. Chef developers are the highest paid but Chef is also the most dreaded other tool.\nBig-data and data streaming skills are well compensated with Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, and Hadoop all in the top three other frameworks and libraries.\nAdditionally, developers that have colocation experience are paid more than their cloud-only counterparts.\nOn average, median salaries increased about 23% between 2021 and 2022. With Flow, COBOL, Couchbase, and IBM Cloud/Watson seeing the largest salary increases year over year.\nTechnology\nA new section for 2022, we ask about use of version control systems - both professionally and personally - as well as how people prefer to interact with it.\nNo other technology is as widely used as Git. Especially among Professional Developers. But for those learning to code, 17% still do not use a version control system.\nThe command line is the primary way developers interact with their version control system\nGitHub is the most popular Version Control for both personal and professional use. GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure Repos are more likely used for professional purposes instead of personal.\nTechnology\nDevelopers are torn on blockchain, crypto, and decentralization. 32% are at least favorable, 31% are unfavorable and 26% are indifferent.\nWhile those learning to code are more favorable than Professional Developers, more of them are also unsure.\nWork\nFull-time employment went up by 4 percentage points for all respondents. Professional Developers that are \u201cIndependent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed\u201d have grown significantly in the last year (up by 5 percentage points).\nIn 2022 this question was changed to multi-select.\nFull-time employment has gone down in the top 5 countries while Independent contractor, freelancer, or self-employed has gone up.\n85% of developers say their organizations are at least partially remote.\nSmaller organizations are most likely to be in-person, with 20% of 2-19 employee organizations in-person.\nThe largest organizations, with 10k+ employees, are most likely to be hybrid.\nWork\n53% of respondents work for an organization that has more than 100 employees.\nWork\nSenior roles like executives and engineering managers tend to have the highest salaries.\nBut in the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, and Canada we see that Blockchain developers have comparable salaries even though they have the lowest average years of experience.\nMedian yearly salary in USD\nYears of experience and a higher salary go hand in hand. The three highest-paid roles have, on average, more than 11 years of experience.\nPHP developers continue to be disproportionately underpaid compared to other languages with the same experience.\nWork\n66% of Professional Developers have at least some influence over their organization\u2019s purchases of new technologies. This is up from 56% in 2020 when we last asked this question.\nUnsurprisingly, senior-level positions have the greatest amount of influence when purchasing new technologies. But with the exception of students, at least 60% of all developer types have at least some influence on purchasing.\nStarting a free trial is the most common way to evaluate new tools. But this is down from 77% in 2020. The other two most common ways of researching new tools are asking a colleague/friend and visiting developer communities like Stack Overflow.\nFor Desktop or Enterprise application developers, they are equally likely to ask a colleague/friend and visit developer communities when they are researching tools.\nWork\n88% of Professional Developers code outside of work, with 73% of them coding as a hobby.\nCommunity is at the center of all that we do. Here we take a look at how people use Stack Overflow and how connected they feel to the community.\nCommunity\nLess than 1% of respondents have never visited Stack Overflow or the Stack Exchange Network.\nMore people learning to code have visited Collectives on Stack Overflow, suggesting it\u2019s a good resource for people who are getting up to speed on a new-to-them technology.\n81% of respondents visit Stack Overflow weekly and 53% of them visit daily.\n8 out of 10 respondents have a Stack Overflow account.\nOf those with a Stack Overflow account, 46% are participating on the site less than once per month or monthly.\n42% of respondents consider themselves \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cdefinitely\u201d a member of the Stack Overflow community. Of these respondents, we see that gender minorities are less likely to consider themselves a member of the Stack Overflow community.\nWe asked Professional Developers to tell us about what impacts their productivity at work, how often it happens, and how much time that takes out of their day. We also asked them about the developer experience at work - do they have the processes, tools, and programs to make it easier to do their jobs.\nProfessional Developers\n72% of all respondents were eligible to participate in our Professional Developer section. Of those eligible, 70% agreed to participate, resulting in over 36,000 responses.\nThe vast majority of respondents are independent (or individual) contributors.\n56% of respondents are in their first 10 years of professional work experience.\nWhile it is possible for developers to become people managers in the first 4 years, we see that it is much more likely after the 5 year mark.\nNearly half of all respondents report that knowledge silos prevent them from getting ideas from across the organization and that waiting for answers to questions often causes interruptions and disrupts their workflow - with little difference between ICs and People Managers.\n57% of People Managers report that they find themselves answering questions that they\u2019ve answered before.\nAbout a quarter of all respondents say they can\u2019t find up-to-date information within their organization to help them do their job and they aren\u2019t able to quickly find answers to their questions with existing tools and resources.\n68% of respondents say they encounter a knowledge silo at least once a week.\nFor People Managers, 73% report encountering a knowledge silo at least once a week.\n62% of all respondents spend more than 30 minutes a day searching for answers or solutions to problems.\n25% spending more than an hour each day. Regardless of being an independent contributor or people manager, this is time that could be spent learning or building.\nFor a team of 50 developers, the amount of time spent searching for answers/solutions adds up to between 333-651 hours of time lost per week across the entire team.\n46% of all respondents spend more than 30 minutes a day answering questions.\n32% of people managers spend over an hour each day just answering questions, while only 14% of independent contributors spend over an hour answering questions.\nFor a team of 50 developers, the amount of time spent answering questions adds up to between 278-568 hours of time lost per week across the entire team.\nOver 48% of respondents regardless of function, think onboarding takes a very long time or a somewhat long time at their organization.\nWhile independent contributors are not directly managing others, 62% of them are involved in supporting new hires.\n78% of respondents say their employer gives them time to learn and 64% use learning resources provided by their employer.\nProfessional Developers\nMost Professional Developers report having CI/CD, DevOps, and Automated Testing available at their organization.\nOnly 38% report having a developer portal to make it easy to find tools and services.\nOnly 16% of organizations have Innersource initiatives.\nHow we planned and analyzed our survey\nMethodology\nThis report is based on a survey of 73,268 software developers from 180 countries around the world. This is the number of responses we consider \u201cqualified\u201d for analytical purposes based on time spent on the full, completed survey; another approximately 53 responses were submitted but not included in the analysis because respondents spent less than three minutes on the survey.\nThe survey was fielded from May 11, 2022 to June 1, 2022.\nThe median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was 15.08 minutes. An increase we expected this year because of additional questions asked.\nRespondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of the collection promotion.\nAs an incentive, respondents who finished the survey could opt in to a \u201cCensus\u201d badge if they completed the survey.\nDue to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was, unfortunately, inaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third-party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\nMany questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\nWe asked respondents about their salaries. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked the respondents what their salary was in that currency and whether that salary was weekly, monthly, or yearly.\nThe salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 38,071 respondents who gave us salary data.\nWe converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on May 24, 2022 and also converted to annual salaries assuming 12 working months and 50 working weeks.\nThe top approximately 2% of salaries inside and outside of the US were trimmed and replaced with threshold values. The threshold values for inside and outside the US were different.\nTo identify which technologies to include in the survey this year, we looked at both the most popular and fastest-growing tags on Stack Overflow (in terms of questions posted). We compared these to the technologies we included last year and looked at how many people chose each option. We synthesized all this together to curate a collection of technologies to include.\nThe questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order. Also, the answers to most questions were randomized in order.\nFree form text responses are primarily used to influence future survey choices but are not included in the published results.\nMethodology\nThe majority of respondents felt like this year\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\nLess than one percent of respondents felt like this year\u2019s survey was difficult.\nMethodology\nSimilar to previous years the overwhelming majority of respondents are a developer by profession.\nOverview\nDeveloper Profile\nTechnology\nWork\nCommunity\nProfessional

Each year, we field a survey covering everything from developers\u2019 favorite technologies to their job preferences. This year marks the ninth year we\u2019ve published our annual Developer Survey results, and nearly 90,000 developers took the 20-minute survey earlier this year.\nDespite our survey\u2019s broad reach and capacity for informing valuable conclusions, we acknowledge that our results don\u2019t represent everyone in the developer community evenly. We have further work to do to make Stack Overflow the welcoming, inclusive, and diverse platform we want it to be, and this is reflected in our survey sample. We are committed to building on steps we\u2019ve taken in 2018 and improving in this area this year and beyond. Some of these survey results directly guide those efforts.\nTo address the characteristics of our data, be sure to check out where we summarize results by country or gender, highlight results for underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, or use survey weighting to correct for demographic skew.\nLook for this icon, which highlights differences between developer demographics.\nWe looked at breakdowns by demographics throughout our analysis, and in most cases it did not have a significant effect. Look for the icon to see where we highlight results where it did have an interesting impact. Also be sure to check out a few new topics this year ranging from hours worked per week to the best music to listen to while coding!\nWant to dive into the results yourself? The anonymized results of the survey are available for download under the Open Database License (ODbL). We look forward to seeing what you find!\nHere are a few of the top takeaways from this year\u2019s results.\nWhat we know about the developers who are writing the script for the future\nEach month, about 50 million people visit Stack Overflow to learn, share, and build their careers. We estimate that 21 million of these people are professional developers and university-level students. The majority of our survey respondents this year were people who said they are professional developers or who code sometimes as part of their work, or are students preparing for such a career. About 4% of respondents code as a hobby but not as a profession, and just under 2% of respondents used to be professional developers but no longer are.\nSee our Methodology section for details on how developers around the world accessed our survey.\nAbout 50% of respondents identify as full-stack developers, and about 17% consider themselves mobile developers. The median number of developer type identifications per respondent this year is 3, and the most common pairs are combinations of back-end, front-end, and full-stack developer. Pairs that are highly correlated include database administrator and system administrator, DevOps specialist and site reliability engineer, academic researcher and scientist, and designer and front-end developer.\nSurvey weighting is an approach used to analyze survey data when the survey sample doesn't match the underlying population well. For example, in our survey this year, 11% of US respondents identify as women, but data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that women's participation in the software developer workforce is about twice that, more like 20%. We can use survey weighting to adjust for the mismatch between our survey sample and the population of developers. We know that there is a difference in developer type representation by gender, so let's compare the overall proportions in our raw results for the United States with weighted proportions, assuming that we undersampled gender minorities at the rate indicated by the BLS report. When we use weighting, we see small increases in the representation of developer roles that have the most representation from women, like designers, and decreases in others with low representation from women, like DevOps.\nWe know there are more ways in which our survey sample doesn't match the underlying population of developers than only gender (including frequency of use of Stack Overflow), and the United States is not the only country for which we expect such a mismatch. The reason we're using this specific example of weighting here is that it is one where we know we have systemic sampling issues and we have an estimate about the expected population proportion. We can demonstrate the effect of our survey sample on our results, both in direction and magnitude.\nAbout 65% of professional developers on Stack Overflow contribute to open source projects once a year or more. Involvement in open source varies with language. Developers who work with Rust, WebAssembly, and Elixir contribute to open source at the highest rates, while developers who work with VBA, C#, and SQL do so at about half those rates.\nMany developers work on code outside of work. About 80% of our respondents say that they code as a hobby. Other responsibilities outside of software can reduce developers' engagement in coding as a hobby; developers who say they have children or other caretaking responsibilities are less likely to code as a hobby. Respondents who are women are also less likely to say they code as a hobby.\nThere is a wide range of experience levels among developers, and a full 45% of professional developers on Stack Overflow learned to code less than 10 years ago. See more on how experience is related to gender.\nOver 40% of respondents have less than five years of professional coding experience. Developers who work with languages such as VBA, F#, and Clojure have the most years of professional coding experience, while developers who work with languages like Python, PHP, and Kotlin have the fewest.\nDevelopers who work in different areas of software development have different average amounts of experience. Aside from technical executives and managers, SREs and developers who build for embedded devices have the most experience, while academic researchers and data scientists have the fewest years of experience. The related roles and disciplines of site reliability engineering and DevOps are somewhat new, but the people working in this field are highly experienced.\nWe asked respondents how old they were the first time they wrote a line of code or program, whether that was to make a webpage or say hello to the world. Overall, over half of respondents had written code by the time they were sixteen, but experience varies widely. There is two years' or more difference in the mean first age from countries like Australia and the UK compared to India and Brazil. If we control for developer age today, we see an even more dramatic disparity between India (where developers who are older today started coding later in life) and the UK (where developers who are older today started coding earlier in life). We also see differences with gender, with women writing their first code later than men and non-binary respondents writing code earlier than men.\nAbout one-quarter of respondents are enrolled in a formal college or university program full-time or part-time.\nWorldwide, about three-fourths of professional developer respondents have the equivalent of a bachelor's degree or higher, consistent with what we've found in previous years. However, it is not that rare to find accomplished professional developers who have not completed a degree.\nOf professional developers who studied at the university level, over 60% said they majored in computer science, computer engineering, or software engineering. This proportion is somewhat higher in currently enrolled students, and the proportion of respondents majoring in other engineering disciplines like electrical and mechanical engineering is lower among current students than among professionals.\nDevelopers are lifelong learners; almost 90% of all developers say they have taught themselves a new language, framework, or tool outside of their formal education. Among professional developers, about 60% say they took an online course like a MOOC (up significantly from last year), and about a quarter have participated in a hackathon.\nWe asked our respondents about their racial/ethnic identities and see evidence that people of color continue to be underrepresented among developers, especially among professional developers. We see higher proportions of people of color in students than professional developers. We have seen incremental improvement in this area year over year. In the United States this year, 22% of respondents are people of color (meaning they chose one or more non-white options on this question); last year 19% of United States respondents were people of color. Like with gender representation, this gradual change is encouraging, but the overall participation levels indicate we still have work to do, both on Stack Overflow and as the tech industry more broadly.\nWe asked our respondents about their gender identity, and found that about globally 90% of our respondents are men. In regions including the United States, India, and the UK, women are represented at higher levels among students than among professional developers.\nThis year 11% of US survey respondents are women, up from 9% on last year's survey. This represents incremental improvement in this area, but the continued low proportion points to problems with inclusion in the tech industry in general and on Stack Overflow in particular.\nThis year, 1.2% of respondents identified as transgender, about double from last year. The gender identification question allowed respondents to select all that apply, and the question about transgender identity was separate from the question about gender identity.\nWe see varying representation from men and women in different developer roles on our survey. All categories have dramatically more developers who identify as men than women but the ratio of men to women varies. Developer types above the line have respondents that are more likely than average to be men, and those below the line have respondents who are more likely than average to be women. Developers who are data scientists or academic researchers are about 10 times more likely to be men than women, while developers who are system admins or DevOps specialists are 25-30 times more likely to be men than women. Women have the highest representation as front-end developers, designers, data scientists, data analysts, QA or test developers, scientists, and educators.\nWhen we look at differences in years since learning to code by gender, we see evidence for the shifting demographics of coding as a profession, as well as retention problems in the tech industry for underrepresented groups. Research shows, for example, that women leave jobs in tech at higher rates than men. Among our respondents, both in the United States and internationally, women are about twice as likely as men to have three years of coding experience or less. Companies interested in building a diverse developer workforce that is more reflective of society should focus on retention of their senior developers from underrepresented groups, along with thoughtful hiring from the population of more junior developers.\nThis is the second year we asked our respondents about their sexual orientation, and the proportions of respondents are mostly consistent since last year.\nIndividuals with many forms of disability and difference are part of the developer community, including those with mental health challenges and physical disabilities. Mental health issues like depression and anxiety are particularly common among our respondents. In the United States, almost 30% of respondents said they deal with a mental health challenge, a higher proportion than other large countries such as the UK, Canada, Germany, or India.\nAbout three-fourths of professional developers who took our survey are younger than 35.\nDevelopers on Stack Overflow are older with more experience in Australia, Western Europe, and North America and younger with less experience in regions like India and Eastern Europe.\nWe asked respondents to evaluate their own competence, for the specific work they do and years of experience they have, and almost 70% of respondents say they are above average while less than 10% think they are below average. This is statistically unlikely with a sample of over 70,000 developers who answered this question, to put it mildly.\nWhen asked to evaluate their own competence for the kind of work they do and their years of experience, men are much more likely to say they are far or a little above average than gender minorities in tech.\nWe specifically asked respondents to evaluate themselves for their years of experience, but we see differences in opinion with experience. New developers are much less likely to evaluate themselves as above average for their experience, and this effect does not flatten out until about 10 years of experience. We see evidence here among the most junior developers for impostor syndrome, pervasive patterns of self-doubt, insecurity, and fear of being exposed as a fraud. Among our respondents, men grew more confident much more quickly than gender minorities.\nFor the second year, we asked respondents if they have children or other dependents that they care for, and almost 40% of respondents say that they do, up from last year.\nThe developers who said they do not have dependents to care for are younger on average with less experience than those who do. Over 60% of developers with 10 or more years of professional coding experience have children or other dependents. Respondents in the United States are more likely to say they have dependents than the rest of the world, but within the US, women are less likely to report having caretaking responsibilities. This fits in with other evidence we see for retention problems specific to underrepresented groups in tech.\nWe've all been there, either giving or receiving help.\nThis question mirrors a question that\u2019s asked by Gallup every year. The 2018 Gallup results saw 61% of the American population believing today's youth will live better than their parents; that percentage was the highest since Gallup\u2019s 2010 survey. If we filter our survey for American respondents, the percentage is also 61%, mirroring Gallup\u2019s results. Either way, it seems that developers don\u2019t overwhelmingly believe we\u2019re headed toward dystopia.\nRespondents in China are the most optimistic, and those in regions like Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East are especially hopeful compared to those in Western Europe. This is especially notable in countries like Germany and France, which are the 4th and 7th largest economies in the world, respectively.\nWe asked our respondents this year what social media site they use the most, and Reddit and YouTube were the most common answers. Developers' preferences aren't reflective of the most popular social media platforms in the world where Facebook ranks first and Reddit doesn\u2019t even crack the top 10. (Reddit has about 330 million active users compared to Facebook\u2019s 2.32 billion monthly users.)\nWhen we look in the United States, the situation is a little different. Twitter and Facebook are ranked higher. Notice that the United States result weighted by gender exhibits some interesting differences from the unweighted result; Instagram even gains a full rank.\nThere have been many iterations on the names we use in chat apps or online communities to identify ourselves. The most common choice for our respondents was username by a landslide. Respondents who chose userId are the oldest, and respondents who chose username are the youngest.\nDevelopers may have a reputation for introversion, but a firm majority of our respondents said they prefer face-to-face conversations to online chat. We're happy to report that only 11% of our respondents said they didn't want to communicate with their fellow human beings via either method.\nWe asked respondents what person they thought would be most influential in 2019 in a free-text field. Besides CEOs of companies including Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Apple, respondents mentioned developers building and maintaining React.js and Vue.js (the most loved web frameworks this year), along with leaders from the Linux world and other tech domains. A few world leaders received mentions from respondents, along with a fair number of humble respondents nominating...themselves! Some individuals mentioned here are likely not viewed favorably by those who listed them, such as the current chairman of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Only one woman made it to the top 25 of this list: Lisa Su, the CEO of AMD.\nThe tools of the trade\nFor the seventh year in a row, JavaScript is the most commonly used programming language, but Python has risen in the ranks again. This year, Python just edged out Java in overall ranking, much like it surpassed C# last year and PHP the year before. Python is the fastest-growing major programming language today.\nThis year, we asked about frameworks for the web separately from other frameworks and libraries. jQuery is the most broadly used of these web frameworks, and this year more developers say they use React.js than Angular, a switch from last year.\nThis is the first year we've asked about many of the technologies in this category, and Node.js is the most commonly used. More developers say they use .NET than .NET Core, and the deep learning framework TensorFlow is many times more popular than the deep learning framework Torch/PyTorch.\nLike last year, MySQL is the most commonly used database. PostgreSQL has taken the second spot this year, edging ahead of Microsoft SQL Server.\nLinux and Windows are the most common platforms that our respondents say they have done development work for this year. We asked about container technologies like Docker for the first time this year, and Docker was the third most broadly used platform.\nFor the fourth year in a row, Rust is the most loved programming language among our respondents, followed close behind by Python, the fastest-growing major language today. This means that proportionally, more developers want to continue working with these than other languages.\nVBA and Objective-C rank as the most dreaded languages this year. Most dreaded means that a high percentage of developers who are currently using these technologies express no interest in continuing to do so.\nPython is the most wanted language for the third year in a row, meaning that developers who do not yet use it say they want to learn it.\nReact.js and Vue.js are both the most loved and most wanted web frameworks by developers, while Drupal and jQuery are most dreaded.\n.NET Core and Torch/PyTorch are both used less than other counterparts in their respective ecosystems (.NET and Tensorflow, respectively) but are loved by developers more. Chef and Cordova rank as the most dreaded in this category of frameworks, libraries, and tools.\nFor the third year in a row, Redis is the most loved database, meaning that proportionally more developers want to continue working with it than any other database. Couchbase and Oracle rank as the most dreaded databases, and for the third year in a row, MongoDB is the most wanted database.\nLinux is once again the most loved platform for development, with both Docker and Kubernetes also highly loved this year. WordPress is the most dreaded development platform, and many developers say they want to start developing using Docker and AWS.\nVisual Studio Code is a dominant player among developer environment tools this year. There are differences in tool choices by developer type and role, but Visual Studio Code was a top choice across the board. Developers who write code for mobile apps are more likely to choose Android Studio and Xcode. A popular choice for DevOps and SREs is Vim, and data scientists are more likely to work in IPython/Jupyter, PyCharm, and RStudio.\nWe asked our respondents what operating systems they use for work. About half said they mainly use Windows, and the remainder were about evenly split between MacOS and Linux.\nWhen asked how they are using container technology such as Docker or Open Container Initiative, about half of our respondents said they are not using any such technology today. Those who are using containers most commonly put them to work in development.\nMost respondents on our survey say their organizations are not using or implementing blockchain technology, and the most common use reported is outside of currency. Developers in India are the most likely to say their organizations are using blockchain technology.\nWhen asked what they primarily believe about blockchain technology, respondents on our survey are largely optimistic about its broad usefulness. This optimism is largely concentrated among young, less experienced developers, however. The more experienced a respondent is, the more likely they are to say blockchain technology is an irresponsible use of resources.\nGlobally, respondents who use Clojure, F#, Elixir, and Rust earn the highest salaries, with median salaries above $70,000 USD. There are regional variations in which languages are associated with the highest pay. Scala developers in the US are among the highest paid, while Clojure and Rust developers earn the most in India.\nTechnologies cluster together into related ecosystems that tend to be used by the same developers. This network graph demonstrates this by showing which technologies are most highly correlated with each other. We see a large cluster on the left for web development (with JavaScript, HTML/CSS, TypeScript, and React.js) connected via SQL to one for Microsoft technologies (with C#, Visual Studio, and .NET Core). Along the lower left we see a mobile constellation connecting Java, Kotlin, Android, and SQLite to iOS and Xcode. This year we observe a cluster of operations technologies with Docker, AWS, and PostgreSQL connected to the Python ecosystem network through Linux. Other smaller correlated clusters include Scala/Spark/Hadoop, C/C++/Assembly, and smaller technologies like language-specific IDEs or frameworks.\nHow developers get down to the business of software\nOver 90% of professional developers are employed at least part-time.\nGermany has an unusually high proportion of developers working part-time. Developers in the United States are somewhat less likely to work as independent contractors or freelancers. In all of these locations, more than 70% of developers are employed full-time.\nSoftware developers work in a diverse range of industries, both inside and outside the technology sector. Of the industry options we used this year, more professional developers said they work for companies doing general software development (not otherwise specified), IT, and finance/banking. Developers working in industries such as consulting, government, and nonprofits have more years of professional coding experience, while those working in web development or SaaS have about half as many median years of coding experience overall.\nDevelopers work in companies of all sizes, from small to large enterprise organizations. More software developers in the United States work at larger companies compared to the rest of the world, including Europe. The more experienced a developer is, the more likely they are to work at a larger company. On average, each additional year of professional coding experience is associated with a 30-person increase in a developer's organizational size.\nAs we've found in previous years, developers tend to be more satisfied with their career than with their current job. Job satisfaction is highest for engineering managers and senior engineering executives, along with SREs and DevOps specialists. Developers with the lowest job satisfaction include academic researchers, educators, scientists, and designers.\nEngineering management is a technical discipline that impacts developers and the work that they do every day. Fortunately, over 80% of respondents are somewhat or very confident that their manager knows what they're doing.\nWhen it comes to their own perceptions of engineering management as a career, half of respondents don't think they necessarily need to move to people management to continue to grow their salary.\nRespondents are evenly divided about their own plans for such a career change, with no single response dominating. Those who say they do not want to be a manager have more years of experience than those who do, with twice as many years of professional coding experience. Developers who are interested today in entering a management path likely have such a career path ahead of them, or perhaps some will change their mind!\nOnly 15% of respondents are actively looking for a job, but almost three-fourths of developers are interested in hearing about new job opportunities.\nJob seeking status is largely consistent across these regions.\nAmong professional developers, those who work as senior engineering executives, DevOps specialists, and SREs are looking for work the least. Developers working in academia and data scientists (categories that we know often overlap) are looking for work at higher proportions.\nOver half of the respondents on our survey have taken a new job within the past two years; frequent job changes are the norm for software developers.\nWe asked our professional developer respondents this year about their last successful interview process that resulted in a job offer, and what type of tasks or interviews they had experienced. The most common experience was being interviewed by senior folks and managers, and less than 40% of respondents report being asked to write any code at all. Women are more likely to report completing a take-home project and less likely to say they were asked to solve a brain-teaser puzzle than men, which is related to the types of roles they are applying for (more front-end and data science roles where take-home projects are prevalent).\nWe also asked respondents if they have ever been asked to solve Fizz Buzz during any interview; almost 15% of respondents have.\nWhen asked about the last time they updated their resume, our respondents were most likely to say it was motivated by starting a new job search. We asked respondents who said they had re-entered the workforce why, and reasons included career changes from other fields, retiring from the military, and years spent caring for children full-time.\nWe asked respondents to picture themselves comparing two jobs with the same compensation, benefits, and location, and consider which characteristics would most influence their choice between the two. Different types of developers apply different sets of priorities when considering jobs. Developers who belong to gender minorities in tech rank the office environment and company culture as their highest concern when assessing a new job, and are more likely to say the diversity of an organization is a top concern for them.\nSince we know that there is difference in opinion about job priorities by gender, let's compare the overall opinion in our raw results with a weighted opinion. Using survey weighting doesn't change the results for most choices dramatically, but the diversity of an organization grows significantly more important.\nAbout 12% of respondents say they work remotely full-time, up a bit from the last time we asked this question two years ago. Developers who work remotely full-time have on average about 60% more years of professional coding experience than those who never do.\nWe asked respondents if they use a schedule or spec to schedule and plan their work, and only 20% said their work closely aligns with such a planning doc. Those who adopt a more flexible approach or don't use any schedule or spec are more likely to have more years of professional coding experience; closely following a schedule or spec is associated with fewer years of experience.\nWhen asked what their greatest challenges to productivity are, developers' most common responses include a distracting work environment and meetings. Gender minority respondents are less likely to say that being tasked with non-development work is a problem for them, and more likely to say that toxic work environments are.\nWe can compare the overall opinion for the United States in our raw results with a weighted opinion. There are small shifts in some challenges to productivity like toxic work environments and meetings.\nFew respondents think that OSS is typically worse than proprietary or closed source software, but opinions are about evenly split between those who say that OSS is typically of better quality and those who say that both models for developing software result in about the same quality. Unsurprisingly, developers who contribute to open source are more likely to say that OSS is of higher quality.\nMost respondents say they review code as part of their work, because it is an important part of the software engineering process. It's not a dominant part of most developers' work week, though. About three-fourths of developers say they spend five hours or less each week reviewing code.\nWe asked respondents if their organization uses unit tests in development, and they are overwhelmingly in favor of unit testing, whether they currently use them or not. In fact, developers at companies who embrace unit testing also have slightly higher job satisfaction.\nWhen asked what musical artist or genre helps them focus, respondents replied with an enormous variety of music, including classical music, video game or movie soundtracks, more kinds of metal than some of us knew existed, and music without lyrics or vocals. A few percent of respondents were clear that they prefer silence for concentrating.\nEngineering managers, SREs, DevOps specialists, and data scientists/engineers command the highest salaries. Average top earning roles are remarkably consistent across the globe, from India to Europe to the United States. See our Methodology section for information on how we converted local currencies used by respondents to U.S. dollars.\nNaturally, developers with more years of experience are paid more. However, some types of coding work are paid more highly at the same level of experience. Developers who work with data (data scientists and engineers) and those who work in DevOps and site reliability are high earners for their level of experience, while academic researchers and educators are paid less at their experience levels.\nDevelopers using languages that appear above the line in this chart, such as Clojure, Scala, Go, Rust, and R, are being paid more even given how much experience they have. Developers using languages below the line, like PHP, Assembly, and VBA, however, are paid less even given years of experience. The size of the circles in this chart represents how many developers are using that language compared to the others.\nFor the first time this year, we asked respondents how many hours they work each week, and three-fourths say they work less than 45 hours per week. Senior executives, product managers, and engineering managers are more likely to work longer hours, as well as developers in Eastern Europe, India, and the United States.\nLooking to hire developers? Learn how with Stack Overflow Talent.\nWhere developers come to learn, share knowledge, and build their careers\nDevelopers visit Stack Overflow. A lot. Our survey respondents likely visit even more than the average developer, since a majority of respondents found the survey from Stack Overflow emails, notifications, and banners. Over 85% of respondents visit Stack Overflow at least a few times per week, with over 60% visiting every day. In the United States, there are only slight shifts between the results weighted by gender and unweighted results on visit frequency.\nMany respondents can't remember when they first visited Stack Overflow. Of those willing to make an estimate, about half say they first visited in the first four years of Stack Overflow's existence, in 2012 or before. This is important background for interpreting our survey results, as our survey sample contains proportionally more long-time community members than the population of Stack Overflow users in general.\nAbout 85% of the participants in our survey say they are registered users with accounts. This is important context for interpreting our survey results, because most Stack Overflow traffic is anonymous, unregistered users.\nOverwhelmingly, developers come to Stack Overflow to find specific answers to specific questions that they have, with almost every respondent selecting this option. Other motivations for visiting are chosen much less often, and by highly engaged members of our community.\nWe asked respondents how many times a week they find answers on our site, on average, and about 60% of respondents say they find answers on Stack Overflow three times a week or more often.\nOver three-fourths of respondents say that using Stack Overflow is faster for solving coding problems than using other resources. If you'd like to speed up your organization's ability to solve problems, learn more about Stack Overflow for Teams.\nWhen asked to compare the last time they solved a problem using Stack Overflow and the last time they used another resource, about 40% of developers say they save 30 minutes or more, and three-quarters of developers agree that they save more than 11 minutes. Combined with the previous results, we can estimate that, conservatively, Stack Overflow saves 30 to 90 minutes of time per developer per week.\nSome developers come to Stack Overflow only to find answers to their questions, while others participate in the community by asking, answering, voting for, or commenting on questions. Over 30% of survey respondents participate on Stack Overflow a few times per month or more often. When comparing United States weighted to unweighted results, we see more representation from those who have never participated on Stack Overflow.\nOver 20% of respondents said they have never participated on Stack Overflow, and we asked them why in a free text question. Many respondents said their questions already had answers, so they felt no need. Others shared different factors, though, including lack of English proficiency, the time commitment involved, and not having enough reputation to contribute the way they want. A few participants perceive the community or site mechanics as too strict or toxic for them to feel safe interacting here.\nAbout half of the respondents to our survey consider themselves part of our community, but this varies for different groups of people. For example, we find that respondents who identify as men see themselves as part of the community at much higher rates than those with other gender identities. The tech community as a whole, and we at Stack Overflow in particular, still have work to do in this area.\nThis year, we at Stack Overflow have been working to publicly acknowledge challenges we face on our site, and to make choices addressing those challenges. Most respondents say they feel about the same as last year, but respondents are twice as likely to say they feel more welcome than less welcome. Respondents who are people of color, especially black or of African descent, South Asian, and Hispanic or Latino/Latina, are especially likely to say they feel more welcome this year, both in the United States and worldwide.\nWe asked respondents in a free text question what one thing they would change about Stack Overflow if they had the chance. Respondents shared ideas including comment privileges at lower reputation, identifying and removing outdated answers, frustrations with duplicate question handling, and issues with community culture.\nThe aspects of Stack Overflow that respondents would like to change exhibit differences across demographic groups. For example, developers who are men are more likely to want change in official site rules (from the algorithms behind them to how they are enforced), while developers who are women are more likely to want to change norms for communication on our site.\nWhen presented with new possible types of content for Stack Overflow, respondents are most interested in tech articles from developers and least interested in industry news. We also got feedback around this question that some respondents were not interested in any of these kinds of changes for Stack Overflow.\nLooking for a place for you and your technical team to ask and answer questions in a secure environment?

This is the number of responses we consider \u201cqualified\u201d for analytical purposes based on time spent on the full, completed survey; another approximately 400 responses were submitted but not included in the analysis because respondents spent less than three minutes on the survey.\nBuilt with \u2665 using  c# jQuery font-awesome bootstrap unicorn tears\nOverview\nKey Results\nDeveloper Profile\nTechnology\nWork\nCommunity\nMethodology\nBack to top\nYour private version of Stack Overflow.\nCreate a secure space for your engineering team to ask and answer private questions.\nLearn more\nPython, the fastest-growing major programming language, has risen in the ranks of programming languages in our survey yet again, edging out Java this year and standing as the second most loved language (behind Rust).\nOver half of respondents had written their first line of code by the time they were sixteen, although this experience varies by country and by gender.\nDevOps specialists and site reliability engineers are among the highest paid, most experienced developers most satisfied with their jobs, and are looking for new jobs at the lowest levels.\nOf the top countries on our survey, China has developers that are the most optimistic, believing that people born today will have a better life than their parents.

I have derived enormous benefit from it (many thanks!!), and I finally decided to become more active. It seems difficult for a \"new\" user to get started.\nA relatively short time ago, I finally created an account to start answering and editing and posting and commenting! I was full of excitement and vigor and immediately tried to upvote (nope!) and post a comment (nope!). I need (threshold) amount of rep to do comment on this or that, or even upvote certain things... which is totally reasonable (perhaps \"necessary\" is a better term).\nSo I browsed a bit (such as whats-reputation). Advice to new users seems to be: just ask, answer, and suggest edits! But there are so many questions and good answers, a truly good question and new question seems hard to create. To truly give justice to all previous questions on a topic requires as much effort (or more?) as posing a question. And there are so many users that to troll-and-pounce the new-questions board could be a full-time job. And BTW, you can only put 2 links in a question when you have <10 rep, so it's very difficult to show due-diligence and to pose a truly good question to begin with!\nI didn't find any actual \"question\" on this topic of how to get started -- but found a few gems like six simple rules, walking a (presumably-intentional) delicate balance between productive debate and provocative cynicism.\nSo I decided to post a question on this topic! Meta.SO seemed like the right place. NOPE! I needed 5 rep to even post a question. Probably also for good reason.\nNow that I have >5 rep (w00t), here I am. After all that background (sorry) --\nHow does anyone get started around here these days?\nMy understanding now boils down to the following:\nWhat am I missing? Do I \"get it\"? Have I completely missed the point? How can The System encourage new users who are here for the \"right reasons\" to quickly start contributing meaningfully and harness their energy for the Common Good?\nIt seems like you get it. Long gone are the days of camping on the front page to gain fast reputation by quickly answering softball questions. The questions are coming in too quickly, site standards have changed drastically, and there's a lot more competition to either answer or close easy questions.\nThe one piece of advice that I'll give you that you haven't mentioned is to pick some favorite tags that you're an expert in and add them to your favorites list (in the main page right sidebar).\nThis will highlight questions with those tags when you view the list of Newest questions, and it will even filter the list of selected questions when you view the Stack Overflow home page so that you see more questions with your favorite tags. By focusing your attention on your favorite tags, you'll see more questions that you're interested in and may be able to answer. You'll also be better able to suggest good edits to questions in your area of expertise.\nYou can also block tags for languages that you don't know by adding them to your Ignored tags list. By default, questions with Ignored tags will just be greyed out, but you can hide them entirely from the Preferences tab in your profile.\nIf you need a little bit of inspiration, here are a few users that have gained a lot of reputation in a relatively short amount of time, despite not having joined the site at the very beginning:\nWhat do they all have in common? They answer tons of questions!\nThere's an alternate route to obtaining basic privileges, if you're finding the competition here too intense.\nIf you hit 200 rep on any site, you'll automatically receive a +100 association bonus on all sites. In my experience earning reputation on the beta sites is extremely easy due to reduced competition. Find a topic you have some expertise on, become a valuable contributor there, and you'll quickly earn your basic privileges. Even better, now you're helping out two sites!\nThink of it as someone else vouching for your trustworthiness, so don't let them down by coming back here and making a mess.\nIf you are reading this, you are probably the sort of person who has the ability to succeed on Stack Overflow. Even so, the tour provides the big picture of how the site ought to work. It also gives you a badge. Another easy badge is Autobiographer, which has the advantage others can learn who you are as a person.\nThe next easiest badge to earn is Editor. Anyone may submit a suggested edit for community review. If you find a mistake or outdated information on any post and you know how to fix it, click on the edit link and suggest a change. Editing is a good way to learn what the community expects from posts and also will familiarize you with how posts are formatted with Markdown. In addition, successfully suggesting edits earns a small amount of reputation.\nIt's almost certainly gotten exponentially harder to ask questions than when many of us earned our (now slightly dusty) beta badges. This chart tells the story:\nNew questions are more likely to be closed or deleted than in the past. It's gotten harder to ask questions that haven't already been asked. In the best of times, asking interesting questions is harder than answering them. So I'd recommend looking for questions you can try answering before starting to ask.\nIf you have a different way of looking at a question, it really doesn't hurt to add another answer even if there's an accepted answer. The goal isn't to just help the one person who asked the question, but to help anyone with that same general problem who might find the question via search. There's no guarantee that your answer will be upvoted, but as long as your answer is accurate, clear, and noticeably different than others, it's not likely to be downvoted.\nThere's a good chance that your question in C, C++, C#, Objective-C, Java, JavaScript, JavaFX, or JSF has already been asked. Less popular languages have less duplication and fewer grouchy grognards who have seen the same few questions asked over and over again. Newer languages tend to not reach that level of saturation, so it might be worthwhile to learn a new language for the purposes of getting started on Stack Overflow. Plus it's a great way to teach yourself programming in 10 years.\nSometimes, you just need some help solving a problem in your code at which point a question on Stack Overflow would be a good entry point. Don't make the mistake of posting your code verbatim. Instead, search for the handful of lines that seem to be buggy. Surprisingly, doing just that is often enough to discover the problem. If your goal is to participate on Stack Overflow, don't be afraid to ask and answer your own question. Be sure to check for duplicate questions before posting (in which case, consider posting your own answer), but don't feel as if your question is wasteful if you already know the answer. Remember that helping the initial asker is not the primary goal of Stack Overflow.\nYou will almost certainly be downvoted at some point using the site. You might get critical comments, have a question closed, or a post deleted. In those situations, it's important to know that:\nFar and away the biggest mistake people make when using the site is ignoring advice they don't immediately understand. When people continue to post without learning what those signals are trying to say, they start running into suspensions, blocks and rate limits.\nMost of the common problems people run into are answered in the help center. In particular, read how to ask and how to answer. If those don't help, look around on meta for other people who have had the same problem. If that still doesn't help go ahead and ask about your specific situation here on meta. Be aware that meta has very similar conventions to the main site. Much of the above advice applies here too.\nTry answering at a time of day or day of week when there are fewer users on Stack Overflow and presumably less competition for answering questions. Yeah, I get that Stack Overflow is an international site and people are on it at all hours of the day, but there are times of the day with significantly less traffic as seen here:\nPlease note these times are GMT.\nSee this post for more details.\nIt appears that Stack Overflow's heaviest users are North America as seen here so the lightest times are when North Americans are sleeping.\nI would imagine there are days of the week that are also that are lighter eg Friday\nPerhaps it is just a coincidence, but I found this out the hard way. I was burning the midnight oil so to speak and posted a question at the lowest activity time and received no answers.\nI started at the end of last year and it was easy enough to rack up a reputation score. I'm a Java expert so I just started browsing the latest Java questions and when I saw a question that looked interesting I posted an answer for it.\nA lot of those questions only need a few lines or a paragraph to answer them. My first ever answer wasn't much over 3 lines but I was lucky and got 6 upvotes. My next few answers got 0 or 1 votes but I persisted and over time got better at answering - and as a result the number of votes I started getting for answers started going up.\nDon't expect to get upvotes or accepts on all of your answers but it only takes a few upvotes to start removing the new user restrictions. One thing that does help a lot is replying both fast and accurately. With multiple correct answers generally the first one posted will get the upvotes.\nIt's actually much easier to get reputation on answers than it is on questions. There are always questions in your favorite topic waiting for you to answer them.\nThere are no limits on how many questions you can answer - so find a way to isolate the questions in an area where you have expertise and then focus on answering the new questions that do not have good answers yet or questions where the existing answers are incomplete. Duplicating existing answers will get you nowhere although sometimes people do post the same answer simultaneously but that cannot be avoided.\nBill the Lizard and Cupcake provide excellent answers. I would just add a few things.\nLearn how to identify motivated question askers. If the asker has been responding to comments, he still needs an answer. If he hasn't, he's more likely to have abandoned the question, so you won't get rep for answer acceptance.\nConsider looking at bounties, especially on tags where you actually are an expert. Anyone who is spending their own rep to get a question answered is likely pretty motivated to get that answer, and will probably be back to select a correct answer - and also to answer requests for clarification, which can help a lot in producing an accepted answer. It can be worth spending quite a bit of effort to answer these questions; for example, on my most successful bounty attempt, I learned parts of an unfamiliar library for a platform I don't write for, but I got 525 rep for it.\nAs you allude to, editing questions is a way to grind past the early newbie levels. In particular, lots of newbie questions have unformatted or poorly formatted code; edits that format the code properly are usually accepted and as a bonus are very helpful to anyone who subsequently reads the question.\nThere's something that isn't really touched on in the other answers, at least that I saw. I read them all but if this is covered in another post, well, oops.\nThe other answers seem to be focused on how to gain reputation and what not. And if that's your goal, cool, those are great answers.\nBut if your goal is to really contribute to the community, do your job (or hobby or whatever it is when you're programming) and when you run into something difficult, post a question. I know answers are much better than questions for rep, but for really learning Stack Exchange, you have to be personally invested.\nIf you go answer someone's question, you might have some attachment to it. Might. But when you ask your own question, it really brings it home. The question that really brought it home for me was this one. I had a problem at work I was given because I was a Java guy and that must mean I knew SQL. But I didn't. But I wasn't one to shy away from the task. So I sought to really understand the problem and thought to myself \"I can describe this in English so easy... and this has to be a common problem... but I can't find the solution anywhere with the terms I'm using...\"\nAnd then this guy came along and completely saved the day. My manager was super happy, and when I told him I just made a Stack Overflow post, he about had to change his pants. He couldn't believe that someone out there just looked at my question and gave me the code snippet I needed to get my job done right. And so quick - it was about half an hour between asking and having it answered.\nAnd ever since then, it's been personal. It's been \"there's people out there with problems, and I want to help them like I was helped.\" I want to help get people out of a bind (when I can, I find I have stretches where there isn't much time). And if you want to feel driven to help people, you have to know what it's like to be helped. And that means you have to ask questions.\nThe only useful tip I can add, that I've found to be extremely convenient, in addition to following your favourite tags, is to make yourself a custom Stack Overflow bookmark; it really helps to weed out everything except whatever it is that you are interested in. Mine, for example:\nClicky\nThis gives a landing page with posts curated to seven of my key tags and sorted with newest posts on top. Obviously you can customize as desired. It saves a lot of clicking around, and it lets you always drop in on new and active posts. In addition, I find that I'm always learning something new along the way, because nearly every question that shows up is automatically relevant. Also, regardless of how frequently people are posting in a given tag, newer posts almost always need answers more than older posts. This isn't to encourage bottom feeding, certainly, but all other things being equal... you still have to be mindful of what you shoot for.\nRead through, pick things that are interesting to you, and just try to answer them. Even if you don't know the answer or even if there is already an answer, just do it anyway - pretend it's a test and you have to come up with a solution; like a personal challenge. Sooner or later you'll be the one coming up with the answer first, best, or both. It's excellent training for general problem solving skills even if you don't get the repuation points most of the time.\nIt's been seven hours and fifteen days*\nIt took me nearly three active months to get 2k rep and this thread helped me quite a lot, so I decided to contribute some findings.\nI can do whatever I want, I can see whomever I choose*\nChoose your favorite tags: Choose a topic you really know something about and have fun thinking and learning about. Be prepared to do some research in order to answer a question. You'll learn a lot. (And earn some rep along the way)\nI go out every night and sleep all day*\nTake advantage of timezones: You'll observe that most answers happen during certain hours a day, in my Tag when Europe or the States are working. At other times of the day or during weekends there is much more time to prepare a \"fast\" answer and less competition.\nI could put my arms around every boy I see*\nBe clear about your knowledge: Don't try to answer each question which sounds somewhat familiar. Only answer when you are sure you are right and you can contribute something useful. There are many smart people around here, you will get bad comments and downvotes when you say something 'silly'.\nTell me baby where did I go wrong*\nAccept critique: It is unavoidable to do silly things in the beginning: bad answers, silly comments. You'll get downvotes and bad comments. Try to understand what they try to tell you and improve.\nI went to the doctor and guess what he told me*\nImitate: Quite soon you'll discover that people from the same small gang tend to be faster, have better answers and get a lot of upvotes for the same questions you are working with. Try to find out what they are doing and try to do the same. In my tag it is @Jon Skeet: He is always well informed, gives very understandable answers with nice code examples, which are explained in layman's terms if necessary. Just study what he is doing and try to do the same.\nI know that living with u baby was sometimes hard, but I'm willing to give it another try*\nDon't give up: The very first active steps on SE are hard. In fact the first steps are the hardest. After your first upvoted answer things start to be fun and it becomes easier with every answer you write, later every comment, every edit. Try to survive the first few active days.\n* Lyrics by Prince for Sinead O'Conner: Nothing Compares 2 U\nEasy steps for getting started at SO.\nAs was already mentioned above, answering is the best way to gain reputation.\nHere are some \"pro\" tips of how to maximize your reputation points per unit of time spent on Stack Overflow, based on personal experience (observing and answering):\nTry not to answer questions that you do not understand. Chance is you will not get it correctly, and/or it will take unreasonable amount of time to argue with OP about \"what they really wanted\". If you feel like the question is unclear, consider leaving a comment, and skipping to the next question. If your comment is later answered, and the question becomes clear enough, and it's still unanswered - now it's your time to give an answer.\nTry to only answer questions if you immediately know the answer, or can figure it out in 2-3 minutes by doing a simple Google search + maybe 1-2 minutes sandboxing in your development environment. This way even if you don't get any reputation points (for example, someone did it faster), you've only wasted 5 minutes of your time. It's very unrewarding to spend even 0.5 hour on someone's question only to find out they already accepted an answer, and never bothered to check other answers. This is relevant to the next point.\nThe faster you answer, the more reputation you can get. This is because other people visiting the question may upvote your answer. You posted late, they've already been to this question and are definitely not coming back just to upvote your answer. There is a caveat - you answer incorrectly - you may get a lot of downvotes. So your initial answer must be fast, precise and actually address the issue in full. You may later edit it and add links to documentation, relevant articles, other Stack Overflow answers, etc. to make it nicer. Don't even try to write a perfect answer from the first attempt. There is a high chance some other user will provide a \"fast\" answer, which will get upvotes, get accepted, and then you finally post your answer, to find out nobody's there to read it.\nWhen answering a 1-2 hours old question, be prepared to waste your time. If a question was not answered immediately (within 10-15 minutes), and especially if it has no upvotes, or worse - a negative score, there is a high chance (I'd say 90%), you will not gain any reputation here (or get an accept 5 days after and that's it). Unless it takes you 5 minutes to answer (generally when it's a complicated subject, but you are an expert in this area), it's best to move on.\nI stumbled on this Q&A and was surprised (or honored :)) to find me quoted in the accepted answer.\nI feel I can share my experience in a detailed answer that I had written earlier but seemed to be off-topic for the question so I deleted it.\nI think it will be more on topic here, and won't hurt people into thinking I'm providing techniques to accumulate rep unfairly. This still requires a lot of work on the site, and it's certainly not designed to game the system (I deleted some upvoted answers because they were wrong, so no, reputation is not the ultimate goal, it's just a consequence of being helpful)\nA few hints to get started & get some reputation/badges on SO. Those are \"techniques\" I used, but I feel that those aren't gaming the system and are fair.\nOn the new questions:\nOn the old questions:\nOn any question:\nA bonus: by keeping a spotless behaviour (asking for precisions in comments, be reactive to comments, helping some users with typo questions by commenting on the error \"for free\", not answering turds, not answering obvious dupes, closing as duplicates with a small personal note to the OP, creating excellent answers,being nice most of the time :)) you may get unrelated upvotes: people wanting to upvote you twice (not recommended, but not serial voting yet), people visiting your profile and finding other good stuff you wrote in the same style and upvoting it)\nAsking (good) questions & answering on meta also proves that you care for the site, not only for the rep. That can have strange effects (I frequently get downvotes on my questions after posting on meta, but upvotes on some answers at the same time!!), but globally it has a positive effect on your \"reputation\" (the one you don't measure with points). Can't hurt.\nGaining a couple of reputation points is not all that hard if you know enough about a certain topic. Just filter for it and start helping people out. A lot of times there is plenty of stuff to add, even if a certain question is answered. Elaborating on a very old question is a good way to earn reputation points and improve Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange. Once you have those 10 reputation points you can edit and improve your own answers with more links.\nIf there are no more questions you can answer or improve and there are no more questions you can ask, then I'm wondering why you want to get started here. If you can not improve there is no reason to get started. On the other hand, I'm a novice hobby programmer, and I can still help out people here and earn some reputation points when I am active enough. I am sure everybody with some knowledge can improve Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange.\nFinally, this site is about putting up good questions with good answers attached to them and not about earning reputation points or some kind of reputation points challenge. Just start, gaining the first 10 reputation points is a cakewalk and from there you can do everything Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange is intended for.\nEdit question, +2 each time suggested edit is accepted => 25 edited questions for reaching the magic 50 threshold\nFact is if your domain of expertise is C++ or Java or any super well known domain , it is almost impossible to find a good enough question not answered/accepted, and if you pick up the newest, it will be answered before you have sent your response.\nBut there are thousands of questions out there that can be improved. Most of them have some Tags missing or some Tags not relevant. Somes can be improved to help understand the issue.\nI was full of excitement and vigor and immediately tried to upvote (nope!) and post a comment (nope!).\nThat's indeed the main problem with the blessed site of Stack Overflow. People take this site as fun, as a game, as anything but sharing knowledge.\nSo, I'd tell you how to really start.\nEnjoy!\nApparently my old advice was SO bad, it wasn't even good, it was just bad.\nSo, here is what NOT to do under any circumstances:\n1. Write 'Any help would be greatly appreciated' at the end of each question, because that's obvious.\n2. Do what I did, and pretend that someone's comment was helpful just to influence them into re-upvoting your question, even if it does give you better rep. Stand up for what you really think! It's better for the community.\n3. Ask a question that you haven't researched, especially one that has a good answer on the very same website (you might embarrass yourself, or make people unreasonably angry).\nHere is what you should do:\nIf someone answers well regarding a piece of code, but you realise that what you posted was a much simpler version of what you're actually attempting, and you now want active help for your HARDER piece of code, just post another question instead of editing your old one. It's not cheating! Someone told me this and said my EDIT was a completely different question, and more people would notice it if I dedicated it to a new question.\nIf programming, then post your precise error - it's easy to do, and it's really hard to get any sympathy without it.\nBe concise with your English. It makes a difference: e.g, 'it is important to note that I have already tried X, Y, and Z' could be said as 'I have already tried X, Y and Z'. Or, 'overly complicated' could be said as 'too complicated'.\nAlso, don't include anything that DOESN'T help people answer your question. For example, backstory. No-one cares. This is an exaggeration, but e.g, 'I've been doing this really hard project at this workshop with an old version of X and we're not allowed to use imported modules for some reason, other than X, and it's taken me ages and I feel like I'm missing something totally obvious; lots of people I know seem to have managed it just fine, but by the way, I was never quite sure if it would be better to do X, Y, Z' will probably alienate your audience. Also, don't say 'I'm really a beginner, I only started python X months ago', because you may as well say 'I don't know anything, I'm so sorry, I'm completely wasting your time'. It's not going to make people answer your question any better.\nI believe answering those questions which you feel comfortable with. Favorite tags will present you specific set of questions.\nHowever, if you genuinely feel an urge to answer a question out of knowledge or interest, then you can go ahead. Don't worry about an up vote or reputation. If you are engaged in a programming language, you yourself got some errors at that particular time, but you resolved it with the help of Google or Stack Overflow. Try to answer such questions, which you are very sure of.\nI don't think it is necessary to answer on a daily basis. Unless and until it's within your helping range, don't go for it.\nYou should first ask yourself why do you want to join this community.\nFigure out weather this is a community you want to be part of. Spend some time and research the type of people that are active contributors here (especially the elitists that run this site). Make sure you take your information from sites that are not under the stack exchange umbrella, since the content of those sites is moderated.\nIn hindsight, that would've made a huge difference, at least in my case.\nSo, to sum up and answer your question, the first thing a new user that wants to join stackoverflow should do is to understand what he's getting into. Failing to do so will result in a lot of wasted hours.\nStart asking to get answers\nFind the answer to your question by asking.\nExplore related questions\nSee similar questions with these tags.\nSite design / logo \u00a9 2025 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under CC BY-SA . rev 2025.7.31.32357\nYou have no choice but to start slowly.\nBe patient and try to do contribute where you can.\nBe prepared to accept initial rejection and failure.\nLearn how to edit and make stuff pretty.\ndiscussion\nnew-users\n37\nAnswer questions when you have something useful to contribute.

If it's \"hard\" to figure out a question to ask, that must mean that you can find an answer to most (if not all) of your problems here. Isn't that a good thing? I suppose trying to answer other people's questions is a decent way to contribute (and gain rep, if that is important). Personally I quickly found I don't really have the patience, as the quality of the questions on the tags I follow are generally quite low, but if you have the patience for it then I would say go for it. Gaining rep isn't the ultimate purpose here though.\n\u2013 \nivarni\nCommented\nApr 30, 2014 at 20:59\n12\nOne frustrating thing is, that I cannot even upvote stuff on other StackExchange-sites, even if I've been active on this particular site. In a way it makes sense, but it's frustrating regardless.\n\u2013 \nF-3000\nCommented\nMay 4, 2014 at 13:09\n12\n@F-3000 There's a per-site +100 association bonus that earns you the basic privileges on all your StackExchange accounts once you hit 200 on any site. That'd take care of your upvote problem.\n\u2013 \nBrad Koch\nCommented\nMay 5, 2014 at 19:01\n7\nI don't know about the West Coast of the US, but over here one's reputation on Stack Overflow carries about as much weight as the number of neighbours you have in Farmville. Maybe even LESS! (Skeet and Gravell exempted of course)\n\u2013 \nGayot Fow\nCommented\nMay 6, 2014 at 0:59\n21\n@BradKoch part of the problem is that 200 points is a much higher bar than it used to be. Most of the good questions will be duplicates, meaning it's rare to get points for asking, and answering will require some combination of speed, writing skills, and specialized knowledge. Speed and writing skills can come with practice, but if you're already discouraged you're unlikely to practice.\n\u2013 \nMark Ransom\nCommented\nMay 7, 2014 at 15:55\n1\n@MarkRansom F-3000 I know it's tough on SO these days. You missed the any site part. On the contrary, little of my rep is from new questions; two populists, a dozen necromancers, and half as many revivals that say speed has nothing to do with it. I don't see an answer that concisely describes what I did; maybe I'll add one soon.\n\u2013 \nBrad Koch\nCommented\nMay 7, 2014 at 16:21\n1\nSee also meta.stackoverflow.com/a/275362/631619\n\u2013 \nMichael Durrant\nCommented\nOct 26, 2014 at 14:24\n1\nas a small \"trick\" for the start: If you register to SO and than any othe rof the SE-sites aswell, you get 100 rep on each. Thus you can at least upvote. Obviosly you should register to SE-sites that you're interested in and at least check out once in a while. Beside that: I don't know if this method is intended or not.\n\u2013 \nDocRattie\nCommented\nJun 30, 2015 at 15:00\n2\nYou ask a question on meta about a critical topic that gets attention. After this, some users will view your profile, and will increase drastically your reputation (consequences of more votes for the questions you've made in the past) if you made a good answer that have not enough views to improve your rep. Coincidence or not, it worked with an answer I made in the Workplace.\n\u2013 \nMalavos\nCommented\nSep 22, 2015 at 18:53\n1\nAlso, is getting started on the site really about the Rep? Isn't it about contributing, and the rep is a consequence? This really huge focus on the reputation causes a drop in quality answer... Fastest gun in the west, incorrect solutions (I tried to flag and edit a lot of them)\n\u2013 \nMalavos\nCommented\nSep 22, 2015 at 18:59\n3\nDear @hoc_age, the six rules are pure gold and they are true indeed. To gain reputation fast you have to look for soft questions and answer them quickly. If the OP recognizes your work is +25 points (answer + upvote, typically). I've been scanning the homepage for hours in order to find the right question and quickly provide the answer and that's how you do gain rep points in SO, sad but true. I've been doing loads of edits as well (fair +2). Also, not surprisingly, some more appropriate answers to heavy subjects (e.g. machine learning) didn't get the attention they deserve.\n\u2013 \nAlessioX\nCommented\nMar 4, 2016 at 21:15\nakrun - Member for 2 years, 6 months with over 220,000 reputation\nWiktor Stribi\u017cew - Member for 2 years, 5 months with over 150,000 reputation\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Fabre - Member for only 6 months, but already has over 24,000 reputation\n5\nMany thanks. Tags added (it's not obvious to me on the \"view\" pages, and not available on my \"user\" page...?) Again, I'd up-vote but even after >1 dozen up-votes on this question alone, it still looks like I have 8 rep?

You can not earn (or lose) reputation on meta.\n\u2013 \nXavi L\u00f3pez\nCommented\nApr 25, 2014 at 14:34\n70\nOne tip: block tags which has a lot of crappy questions for example [facebook*].

The bonus exists for a reason: we only need to validate your basic trustworthiness once. It doesn't really matter where you earn that trust so long as you uphold it.\n\u2013 \nBrad Koch\nCommented\nMay 8, 2014 at 13:54\n1\n@BradKoch Yet answering protected questions and downvoting require 110 and 125, specifically to shut out low-quality contributions to Hot Network Questions from users with the bonus. So it does matter on which SE site you earned that trust. And only SO rep counts for Careers.\n\u2013 \nDamian Yerrick\nCommented\nDec 29, 2014 at 19:18\n7\n@sebastian - you hit on my experience exactly.

The OP was mentioning that people are waiting to pounce on any new question and answer it right away. There are less people waiting to pounce on any given question at lower traffic times. From personal experience I do find that if I ask a question late in the day, it usually does not get answered until the next day.\n\u2013 \nLouise Eggleton\nCommented\nMay 8, 2014 at 14:08\n5\nWhile there will be less competition, the disadvantage is that there are also less views, which could potentially translate into less upvotes. So there are both pros and cons to your time-of-day based approach.\n\u2013 \nuser456814\nCommented\nMay 8, 2014 at 20:01\nTrue, though for a new user just looking to gain some rep to get some privileges and/or remove restrictions, small gains are not such a bad thing.\n\u2013 \nLouise Eggleton\nCommented\nMay 9, 2014 at 4:24\nDo you get rep from upvotes in meta?\n\u2013 \nRuchir Baronia\nCommented\nDec 4, 2015 at 2:09\n@RuchirBaronia, No\n\u2013 \nLouise Eggleton\nCommented\nDec 4, 2015 at 10:23\nThere's a couple of updated charts in an answer on MSE.\n\u2013 \nBSMP\nCommented\nApr 16, 2021 at 17:16\n1\nThis has to be one of the most useful posts on SO!\n\u2013 \nMT1\nCommented\nMay 30, 2022 at 10:04\n64\n15k rep in 4 months.

As I said I'm a Java expert, if you don't have expertise in a reasonably popular and active field it's not going to be so easy but it is still doable. You also need to be active in finding and answering questions. I've written 862 answers...which is around 7 a day.\n\u2013 \nTim B\nCommented\nApr 25, 2014 at 15:58\n2\nI'm less active than @TimB, but when I wanted to post a bounty on my first question I was able to accumulate enough reputation in a few days, mainly from the \"java\" and \"algorithm\" tags. I have some Java experience, and have taken a graduate course on algorithm design.\n\u2013 \nPatricia Shanahan\nCommented\nApr 26, 2014 at 8:57\n48\nWhile this is good advice for gaining reputation, it's not the best advice for improving the site. If there were less pressure to answer quickly, more people would take the time to provide more complete answers.\n\u2013 \nWarren Dew\nCommented\nApr 27, 2014 at 5:43\n6\n@WarrenDew I agree, and that is one reason I said accurately in my reply. Unfortunately though the first reply generally accumulates the upvotes as a natural consequence of the way the site works.

As long as you post regularly (1x or 2x per day) and occasionally get upvoted, a new user can expect to get about 50 rep within a week and a half.\n\u2013 \nParallax Sugar\nCommented\nMar 1, 2017 at 18:17\n@gunr2171 3 months, 467 rep.

If the asker has been responding to comments, he still needs an answer. If he hasn't, he's more likely to have abandoned the question, so you won't get rep for answer acceptance.\nConsider looking at bounties, especially on tags where you actually are an expert. Anyone who is spending their own rep to get a question answered is likely pretty motivated to get that answer, and will probably be back to select a correct answer - and also to answer requests for clarification, which can help a lot in producing an accepted answer. It can be worth spending quite a bit of effort to answer these questions; for example, on my most successful bounty attempt, I learned parts of an unfamiliar library for a platform I don't write for, but I got 525 rep for it.\nAs you allude to, editing questions is a way to grind past the early newbie levels. In particular, lots of newbie questions have unformatted or poorly formatted code; edits that format the code properly are usually accepted and as a bonus are very helpful to anyone who subsequently reads the question.\n9\nWith the bounties, I have actually began further research into things I didn't think I had interest in, but because that was motivation for me I began to use them more. +1\n\u2013 \nLiam McInroy\nCommented\nApr 28, 2014 at 0:25\n1\nIt surprised me how many bounty questions are easily answerable if you simply take an hour to replicate the asker's environment and debug actual, running code. I've had zero competition on the 3 questions I've done this with, so it was easy rep.\n\u2013 \nMichael Kropat\nCommented\nMay 7, 2014 at 16:01\n1\n@MichaelKropat In the hour you replicate the OP's environment: a) how many correct answers to easier questions could you have submitted? b) you run the risk of having someone else scoop you. And then there are those bounty givers who become disinterested (I've seen it) or decide that your answer is not quite what they want so accept their own answer, based on yours (I've seen this too). If the tag is popular you may still get enough upvotes to get 1/2 the bounty. If not then you get no bounty. When I answer a bounty question the rep math is not the justification for it.\n\u2013 \nLouis\nCommented\nJan 3, 2015 at 12:38\nDo you get rep from upvotes in meta?\n\u2013 \nRuchir Baronia\nCommented\nDec 4, 2015 at 2:09\n@RuchirBaronia No, you do not get rep from meta upvotes.\n\u2013 \nWarren Dew\nCommented\nDec 4, 2015 at 6:11\nThank you.

I mistook the genuine concern people have for this site as hostility towards anyone new. I got it, eventually.\n\u2013 \nuser5889203\nCommented\nFeb 18, 2016 at 14:15\nTry not to answer questions that you do not understand. Chance is you will not get it correctly, and/or it will take unreasonable amount of time to argue with OP about \"what they really wanted\". If you feel like the question is unclear, consider leaving a comment, and skipping to the next question. If your comment is later answered, and the question becomes clear enough, and it's still unanswered - now it's your time to give an answer.\nTry to only answer questions if you immediately know the answer, or can figure it out in 2-3 minutes by doing a simple Google search + maybe 1-2 minutes sandboxing in your development environment. This way even if you don't get any reputation points (for example, someone did it faster), you've only wasted 5 minutes of your time. It's very unrewarding to spend even 0.5 hour on someone's question only to find out they already accepted an answer, and never bothered to check other answers. This is relevant to the next point.\nThe faster you answer, the more reputation you can get. This is because other people visiting the question may upvote your answer. You posted late, they've already been to this question and are definitely not coming back just to upvote your answer. There is a caveat - you answer incorrectly - you may get a lot of downvotes. So your initial answer must be fast, precise and actually address the issue in full. You may later edit it and add links to documentation, relevant articles, other Stack Overflow answers, etc. to make it nicer. Don't even try to write a perfect answer from the first attempt. There is a high chance some other user will provide a \"fast\" answer, which will get upvotes, get accepted, and then you finally post your answer, to find out nobody's there to read it.\nWhen answering a 1-2 hours old question, be prepared to waste your time. If a question was not answered immediately (within 10-15 minutes), and especially if it has no upvotes, or worse - a negative score, there is a high chance (I'd say 90%), you will not gain any reputation here (or get an accept 5 days after and that's it). Unless it takes you 5 minutes to answer (generally when it's a complicated subject, but you are an expert in this area), it's best to move on.\n1\nI'm not sure we should be encouraging answers posted in a few minutes, nor as quickly as possible after the question is asked - both may result in poor quality answers. Your last point doesn't concur fully with my experience: sometimes a great answer posted several days later than the others will cause the OP to switch the acceptance over, and it will attract upvotes. Moreover, the unicorn rep is nice 'n all, but it should not be the sole driver of using the site - genuinely wanting to help is a better motivation, imo.\n\u2013 \nhalfer\nCommented\nMay 5, 2014 at 22:52\n@halfer: All of it comes from my personal experience on SO. I am not saying this is the way how it should work. But unfortunately, I learnt it the hard way. Somebody better versed with MATLAB and other tools can calculate correlation matrices, do cluster analysis and such, based on real Q/A data from different users. But I am mostly sure they will come up to the same ideas. Why it works like that - is another story. Regarding your \"great answer several days later\" example, a proof link would help. Also some stats would be nice, i.e. this case vs other cases like that.\n\u2013 \nVictor Zakharov\nCommented\nMay 6, 2014 at 2:36\n@halfer: Think of it this way (example). To maximize your tax return, you can use numerous loop holes in the tax system. The more successful businessman you are, the more loop holes you know, or so does your accountant. And while this behavior is certainly not encouraged by government, it was, is, and will be the best way to keep money in your pocket, with taxes normally eating >50% of your income. Now the question is, if you know such a loop hole, would you use it yourself? (Knowing that other people use it and benefit from it) Would you share this information with anyone?\n\u2013 \nVictor Zakharov\nCommented\nMay 6, 2014 at 2:42\n1\n:). Heh, I smiled at your tax example, but I don't think it is a good analogy for reputation on the site. There's no limited supply of \"money\" and it cannot be \"spent\", so why hoard it? Admittedly it is intriguing to achieve rep milestones (e.g. 10K mod tools) and it can be helpful as an real-life online CV, but after that, I don't recommend worrying about it too much.\n\u2013 \nhalfer\nCommented\nMay 6, 2014 at 7:33\n1\nI am not saying this is the way how it should work - if you mean that you believe you yourself are operating outside the spirit of the thing, then write a proposal to change how the rep system works, or comment on an existing one. (e.g. I am interested in removing reputation awarded from closed questions - I think that might help reduce the amount of quick-draw easy-rep answers that you describe).\n\u2013 \nhalfer\nCommented\nMay 6, 2014 at 7:36\n1\n@halfer: Thanks for your support, but I tried to suggest a feature here several times, from a very simple one to a very complex one. None of them were ever implemented, even though a simple one would take like 1hr of development time. Some got upvoted, some got downvoted, but no action taken to date. If interested, see my stackexchange meta account (this is where my suggestions ended up after migration).\n\u2013 \nVictor Zakharov\nCommented\nMay 6, 2014 at 11:23\n1\n@halfer: And yeah, I am not \"operating\" as much as I used to - you can see my profile. Partly because of the broken spirit. I see people still providing good answers, but it's not the same thrill.\n\u2013 \nVictor Zakharov\nCommented\nMay 6, 2014 at 11:25\nSometimes late answers do pay off\n\u2013 \nPeter Mortensen\nCommented\nFeb 2, 2015 at 21:51\n@PeterMortensen: I'm sure one can find some statistics to prove a point that bigger part of reputation comes from \"quick draw\" answers. People often like to use Jon Skeet as an example, so here it goes - 9min accepted answer, 54 upvotes, and btw, this was 2 days ago. Not saying that old school doesn't work, it's just not as efficient to \"farm\" rep.\n\u2013 \nVictor Zakharov\nCommented\nFeb 3, 2015 at 1:56\nYou need to be ahead. Being to be one of the first to read the new questions is a real must have (to answer newer questions on popular tags like python, java, C++, C). That means you have to spend a lot of time on the site, or frequently check new questions all along your day.\nTo be ahead, tune your filters to avoid seeing all questions. You won't be able to follow, and you cannot know all the languages/technologies.\nDon't lose time answering crap questions. A question with a score of -4 is very likely to be closed / ignored. You'll waste your time, and won't even get an acceptance from OP who doesn't have a clue (you might get 1 upvote, maybe or some downvotes). And in the meanwhile, you're missing better questions.\nFor some questions, you have to be a FGITW (be the fastest to answer), but your answer must be spot on. So stay sharp and drink coffee (with a straw so you can keep on typing)\nFor some questions, it's better to comment, ask clarifications, leave other FGITWs answer (and do it wrong because they actually didn't read the comments). While all bad answers are being posted, hone yours, make it better/more detailed/more performant than the others and post it afterwards. The combination of \"a lot of comments\" then \"an answer\" is appreciated by followers, because you took your time before answering properly.\nDon't answer obvious duplicates. Instead, vote to close / hammer them if you can. You'll be punished by some (specially if you have a high reputation) by answering. You should know better. Instead, you can answer the \"original\" question if you feel something is missing. I did that once, and my answer now has a +10 score.\nThere's a \"new answers to old question\" review queue. I think that's where I got my first +1, because I added a above average by answering to an old question and I was a newbie so someone wanted to encourage me.\nOf course if you're a specialist of some obscure/less popular tags (like Ada) you'll get upvotes on older answers by followers of those tags / people who have the \"active\" setting in SO page to see not only new questions, but active ones (which is impossible to follow on the popular tags BTW)\nOnce you posted, edit your answer to add details. If it's already good, you can get upvotes, but enhancing it makes it \"active\" again, and if it's better you may get more upvotes.\nAnswer the comments made on your answers. Some commenters upvote if you answer them (better: edit your answer to take their questions into account if worth it). Plus it means that you care.\nIf you feel it's wrong, delete it, edit it, undelete it. You'll save a stray downvote.\nUpvote concurrent answers if they're good (you'll even get a \"sportsmanship\" silver badge for that eventually). It creates a gap between your score and the other(s) answers, which isn't necessarily bad. Some may even think that yours have not enough votes // the others and that could even play your way (don't do that just to achieve that result, though)\nIf the question is bad, but you still want to help, you can comment on what's wrong. Doesn't hurt, and you'll get known as a nice fellow.\nDon't answer like you would comment. If you don't feel like answering, then don't, and just comment.\nAlso upvote the good questions. That'll make them visible, only if it's worth, not to indirectly promote your answer. A lot of people forget to do that. Good questions need love too.\nMany people are answering their own questions, and approaching SO as a gang sport. Improving the questions, answers and tagging of others is admirable and Socratic, but will not do much for your fantasy social credit nerd score (SO rep).\n\u2013 \nBirkensox\nCommented\nAug 18, 2019 at 21:24\nRegister.\nStart answering.\nNEVER read the question body, but only tags and title\nWrite an answer that just looks like a good one (preferably just copy and paste some code snippet from manual, or other answer, if you want to bring some explanation along), but has no real relation to the problem.\nGet deserved and hard-earned upvotes a ton\nDon't be afraid of getting some downvotes - as long as your answer looks like a good one, the only downvote you can get from someone who have a clue and time to bother, but such people are scarce.

Also keep in mind that on Meta, votes do not affect your rep. So if the negative \"rep\" is what you mean by that \"bad impression,\" it won't actually affect anything. Cleaning up bad or incorrect answers is never a bad idea. You may decide to leave it up to show what not to do in this case, if you wish, or you may decide to research what was wrong with your points and explain why they're wrong. That's up to you.\n\u2013 \nKendra\nCommented\nFeb 27, 2017 at 22:54\nAs a side note, I do encourage you to try to look into your points and see where the community feels you're wrong.

If it's \"hard\" to figure out a question to ask, that must mean that you can find an answer to most (if not all) of your problems here. Isn't that a good thing? I suppose trying to answer other people's questions is a decent way to contribute (and gain rep, if that is important). Personally I quickly found I don't really have the patience, as the quality of the questions on the tags I follow are generally quite low, but if you have the patience for it then I would say go for it. Gaining rep isn't the ultimate purpose here though.\n\u2013 \nivarni\nCommented\nApr 30, 2014 at 20:59\n12\nOne frustrating thing is, that I cannot even upvote stuff on other StackExchange-sites, even if I've been active on this particular site. In a way it makes sense, but it's frustrating regardless.\n\u2013 \nF-3000\nCommented\nMay 4, 2014 at 13:09\n12\n@F-3000 There's a per-site +100 association bonus that earns you the basic privileges on all your StackExchange accounts once you hit 200 on any site. That'd take care of your upvote problem.\n\u2013 \nBrad Koch\nCommented\nMay 5, 2014 at 19:01\n7\nI don't know about the West Coast of the US, but over here one's reputation on Stack Overflow carries about as much weight as the number of neighbours you have in Farmville. Maybe even LESS! (Skeet and Gravell exempted of course)\n\u2013 \nGayot Fow\nCommented\nMay 6, 2014 at 0:59\n21\n@BradKoch part of the problem is that 200 points is a much higher bar than it used to be. Most of the good questions will be duplicates, meaning it's rare to get points for asking, and answering will require some combination of speed, writing skills, and specialized knowledge. Speed and writing skills can come with practice, but if you're already discouraged you're unlikely to practice.\n\u2013 \nMark Ransom\nCommented\nMay 7, 2014 at 15:55\n1\n@MarkRansom F-3000 I know it's tough on SO these days. You missed the any site part. On the contrary, little of my rep is from new questions; two populists, a dozen necromancers, and half as many revivals that say speed has nothing to do with it. I don't see an answer that concisely describes what I did; maybe I'll add one soon.\n\u2013 \nBrad Koch\nCommented\nMay 7, 2014 at 16:21\n1\nSee also meta.stackoverflow.com/a/275362/631619\n\u2013 \nMichael Durrant\nCommented\nOct 26, 2014 at 14:24\n1\nas a small \"trick\" for the start: If you register to SO and than any othe rof the SE-sites aswell, you get 100 rep on each. Thus you can at least upvote. Obviosly you should register to SE-sites that you're interested in and at least check out once in a while. Beside that: I don't know if this method is intended or not.\n\u2013 \nDocRattie\nCommented\nJun 30, 2015 at 15:00\n2\nYou ask a question on meta about a critical topic that gets attention. After this, some users will view your profile, and will increase drastically your reputation (consequences of more votes for the questions you've made in the past) if you made a good answer that have not enough views to improve your rep. Coincidence or not, it worked with an answer I made in the Workplace.\n\u2013 \nMalavos\nCommented\nSep 22, 2015 at 18:53\n1\nAlso, is getting started on the site really about the Rep? Isn't it about contributing, and the rep is a consequence? This really huge focus on the reputation causes a drop in quality answer... Fastest gun in the west, incorrect solutions (I tried to flag and edit a lot of them)\n\u2013 \nMalavos\nCommented\nSep 22, 2015 at 18:59\n3\nDear @hoc_age, the six rules are pure gold and they are true indeed. To gain reputation fast you have to look for soft questions and answer them quickly. If the OP recognizes your work is +25 points (answer + upvote, typically). I've been scanning the homepage for hours in order to find the right question and quickly provide the answer and that's how you do gain rep points in SO, sad but true. I've been doing loads of edits as well (fair +2). Also, not surprisingly, some more appropriate answers to heavy subjects (e.g. machine learning) didn't get the attention they deserve.\n\u2013 \nAlessioX\nCommented\nMar 4, 2016 at 21:15\nakrun - Member for 2 years, 6 months with over 220,000 reputation\nWiktor Stribi\u017cew - Member for 2 years, 5 months with over 150,000 reputation\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Fabre - Member for only 6 months, but already has over 24,000 reputation\n5\nMany thanks. Tags added (it's not obvious to me on the \"view\" pages, and not available on my \"user\" page...?) Again, I'd up-vote but even after >1 dozen up-votes on this question alone, it still looks like I have 8 rep? I have so much to learn about actually contributing to this site. :)\n\u2013 \nhoc_age\nCommented\nApr 25, 2014 at 14:33\n14\n@hoc_age from What is \"meta\"?: Votes on meta do not affect your reputation; your meta reputation is the same as your reputation on Stack Overflow (synchronized hourly). You can not earn (or lose) reputation on meta.\n\u2013 \nXavi L\u00f3pez\nCommented\nApr 25, 2014 at 14:34\n70\nOne tip: block tags which has a lot of crappy questions for example [facebook*].

I really would have liked to post comment in the beginng, because often i didn't understand an aspect or wanted to expand on an good answer. Well it's like wikipedia, soon nobody will want to register because the elitist will downvote every new user mercilessly.\n\u2013 \nSebastian Schmitz\nCommented\nMay 8, 2014 at 13:26\n30\nYou very much should not think of it as \"gaming the system\". The bonus exists for a reason: we only need to validate your basic trustworthiness once. It doesn't really matter where you earn that trust so long as you uphold it.\n\u2013 \nBrad Koch\nCommented\nMay 8, 2014 at 13:54\n1\n@BradKoch Yet answering protected questions and downvoting require 110 and 125, specifically to shut out low-quality contributions to Hot Network Questions from users with the bonus. So it does matter on which SE site you earned that trust. And only SO rep counts for Careers.\n\u2013 \nDamian Yerrick\nCommented\nDec 29, 2014 at 19:18\n7\n@sebastian - you hit on my experience exactly. I don't feel up to giving answer, but can contribute with a comment. Yet cant' because I'm too new. And in the process I see new people run off a bit by the process and negatives.\n\u2013 \ncurls\nCommented\nSep 30, 2015 at 6:20\n1\nThis is the best way, imo. I tried for months to find good questions to answer, and I tried to find questions that somebody else hadn't asked. . . never happened. So, I answered a few questions on sci-fi and broke through the association bonus! And here I am now, mostly still lurking.\n\u2013 \nJeutnarg\nCommented\nJun 1, 2016 at 19:13\nAgreed.

The OP was mentioning that people are waiting to pounce on any new question and answer it right away. There are less people waiting to pounce on any given question at lower traffic times. From personal experience I do find that if I ask a question late in the day, it usually does not get answered until the next day.\n\u2013 \nLouise Eggleton\nCommented\nMay 8, 2014 at 14:08\n5\nWhile there will be less competition, the disadvantage is that there are also less views, which could potentially translate into less upvotes. So there are both pros and cons to your time-of-day based approach.\n\u2013 \nuser456814\nCommented\nMay 8, 2014 at 20:01\nTrue, though for a new user just looking to gain some rep to get some privileges and/or remove restrictions, small gains are not such a bad thing.\n\u2013 \nLouise Eggleton\nCommented\nMay 9, 2014 at 4:24\nDo you get rep from upvotes in meta?\n\u2013 \nRuchir Baronia\nCommented\nDec 4, 2015 at 2:09\n@RuchirBaronia, No\n\u2013 \nLouise Eggleton\nCommented\nDec 4, 2015 at 10:23\nThere's a couple of updated charts in an answer on MSE.\n\u2013 \nBSMP\nCommented\nApr 16, 2021 at 17:16\n1\nThis has to be one of the most useful posts on SO!\n\u2013 \nMT1\nCommented\nMay 30, 2022 at 10:04\n64\n15k rep in 4 months.

As I said I'm a Java expert, if you don't have expertise in a reasonably popular and active field it's not going to be so easy but it is still doable. You also need to be active in finding and answering questions. I've written 862 answers...which is around 7 a day.\n\u2013 \nTim B\nCommented\nApr 25, 2014 at 15:58\n2\nI'm less active than @TimB, but when I wanted to post a bounty on my first question I was able to accumulate enough reputation in a few days, mainly from the \"java\" and \"algorithm\" tags. I have some Java experience, and have taken a graduate course on algorithm design.\n\u2013 \nPatricia Shanahan\nCommented\nApr 26, 2014 at 8:57\n48\nWhile this is good advice for gaining reputation, it's not the best advice for improving the site. If there were less pressure to answer quickly, more people would take the time to provide more complete answers.\n\u2013 \nWarren Dew\nCommented\nApr 27, 2014 at 5:43\n6\n@WarrenDew I agree, and that is one reason I said accurately in my reply. Unfortunately though the first reply generally accumulates the upvotes as a natural consequence of the way the site works. Quality will win out on more important questions though since they are the ones that get visited after the first few hours.\n\u2013 \nTim B\nCommented\nApr 27, 2014 at 21:22\n3\n\"it only takes a few upvotes to start removing the new user restrictions\" - that is the saving grace of SO for new users. As a new user I discovered that I just needed to put forth a good answer 1 or 2 times, and then everything got better.\n\u2013 \nlevininja\nCommented\nSep 29, 2015 at 16:38\nThat's right - It's actually surprising what difference a couple of upvotes can make, perhaps 10 at a time or more. As long as you post regularly (1x or 2x per day) and occasionally get upvoted, a new user can expect to get about 50 rep within a week and a half.\n\u2013 \nParallax Sugar\nCommented\nMar 1, 2017 at 18:17\n@gunr2171 3 months, 467 rep.

If the asker has been responding to comments, he still needs an answer. If he hasn't, he's more likely to have abandoned the question, so you won't get rep for answer acceptance.\nConsider looking at bounties, especially on tags where you actually are an expert. Anyone who is spending their own rep to get a question answered is likely pretty motivated to get that answer, and will probably be back to select a correct answer - and also to answer requests for clarification, which can help a lot in producing an accepted answer. It can be worth spending quite a bit of effort to answer these questions; for example, on my most successful bounty attempt, I learned parts of an unfamiliar library for a platform I don't write for, but I got 525 rep for it.\nAs you allude to, editing questions is a way to grind past the early newbie levels. In particular, lots of newbie questions have unformatted or poorly formatted code; edits that format the code properly are usually accepted and as a bonus are very helpful to anyone who subsequently reads the question.\n9\nWith the bounties, I have actually began further research into things I didn't think I had interest in, but because that was motivation for me I began to use them more. +1\n\u2013 \nLiam McInroy\nCommented\nApr 28, 2014 at 0:25\n1\nIt surprised me how many bounty questions are easily answerable if you simply take an hour to replicate the asker's environment and debug actual, running code. I've had zero competition on the 3 questions I've done this with, so it was easy rep.\n\u2013 \nMichael Kropat\nCommented\nMay 7, 2014 at 16:01\n1\n@MichaelKropat In the hour you replicate the OP's environment: a) how many correct answers to easier questions could you have submitted? b) you run the risk of having someone else scoop you. And then there are those bounty givers who become disinterested (I've seen it) or decide that your answer is not quite what they want so accept their own answer, based on yours (I've seen this too). If the tag is popular you may still get enough upvotes to get 1/2 the bounty. If not then you get no bounty. When I answer a bounty question the rep math is not the justification for it.\n\u2013 \nLouis\nCommented\nJan 3, 2015 at 12:38\nDo you get rep from upvotes in meta?\n\u2013 \nRuchir Baronia\nCommented\nDec 4, 2015 at 2:09\n@RuchirBaronia No, you do not get rep from meta upvotes.\n\u2013 \nWarren Dew\nCommented\nDec 4, 2015 at 6:11\nThank you.

I mistook the genuine concern people have for this site as hostility towards anyone new. I got it, eventually.\n\u2013 \nuser5889203\nCommented\nFeb 18, 2016 at 14:15\nTry not to answer questions that you do not understand. Chance is you will not get it correctly, and/or it will take unreasonable amount of time to argue with OP about \"what they really wanted\". If you feel like the question is unclear, consider leaving a comment, and skipping to the next question. If your comment is later answered, and the question becomes clear enough, and it's still unanswered - now it's your time to give an answer.\nTry to only answer questions if you immediately know the answer, or can figure it out in 2-3 minutes by doing a simple Google search + maybe 1-2 minutes sandboxing in your development environment. This way even if you don't get any reputation points (for example, someone did it faster), you've only wasted 5 minutes of your time. It's very unrewarding to spend even 0.5 hour on someone's question only to find out they already accepted an answer, and never bothered to check other answers. This is relevant to the next point.\nThe faster you answer, the more reputation you can get. This is because other people visiting the question may upvote your answer. You posted late, they've already been to this question and are definitely not coming back just to upvote your answer. There is a caveat - you answer incorrectly - you may get a lot of downvotes. So your initial answer must be fast, precise and actually address the issue in full. You may later edit it and add links to documentation, relevant articles, other Stack Overflow answers, etc. to make it nicer. Don't even try to write a perfect answer from the first attempt. There is a high chance some other user will provide a \"fast\" answer, which will get upvotes, get accepted, and then you finally post your answer, to find out nobody's there to read it.\nWhen answering a 1-2 hours old question, be prepared to waste your time. If a question was not answered immediately (within 10-15 minutes), and especially if it has no upvotes, or worse - a negative score, there is a high chance (I'd say 90%), you will not gain any reputation here (or get an accept 5 days after and that's it). Unless it takes you 5 minutes to answer (generally when it's a complicated subject, but you are an expert in this area), it's best to move on.\n1\nI'm not sure we should be encouraging answers posted in a few minutes, nor as quickly as possible after the question is asked - both may result in poor quality answers. Your last point doesn't concur fully with my experience: sometimes a great answer posted several days later than the others will cause the OP to switch the acceptance over, and it will attract upvotes. Moreover, the unicorn rep is nice 'n all, but it should not be the sole driver of using the site - genuinely wanting to help is a better motivation, imo.\n\u2013 \nhalfer\nCommented\nMay 5, 2014 at 22:52\n@halfer: All of it comes from my personal experience on SO. I am not saying this is the way how it should work. But unfortunately, I learnt it the hard way. Somebody better versed with MATLAB and other tools can calculate correlation matrices, do cluster analysis and such, based on real Q/A data from different users. But I am mostly sure they will come up to the same ideas. Why it works like that - is another story. Regarding your \"great answer several days later\" example, a proof link would help. Also some stats would be nice, i.e. this case vs other cases like that.\n\u2013 \nVictor Zakharov\nCommented\nMay 6, 2014 at 2:36\n@halfer: Think of it this way (example). To maximize your tax return, you can use numerous loop holes in the tax system. The more successful businessman you are, the more loop holes you know, or so does your accountant. And while this behavior is certainly not encouraged by government, it was, is, and will be the best way to keep money in your pocket, with taxes normally eating >50% of your income. Now the question is, if you know such a loop hole, would you use it yourself? (Knowing that other people use it and benefit from it) Would you share this information with anyone?\n\u2013 \nVictor Zakharov\nCommented\nMay 6, 2014 at 2:42\n1\n:). Heh, I smiled at your tax example, but I don't think it is a good analogy for reputation on the site. There's no limited supply of \"money\" and it cannot be \"spent\", so why hoard it? Admittedly it is intriguing to achieve rep milestones (e.g. 10K mod tools) and it can be helpful as an real-life online CV, but after that, I don't recommend worrying about it too much.\n\u2013 \nhalfer\nCommented\nMay 6, 2014 at 7:33\n1\nI am not saying this is the way how it should work - if you mean that you believe you yourself are operating outside the spirit of the thing, then write a proposal to change how the rep system works, or comment on an existing one. (e.g. I am interested in removing reputation awarded from closed questions - I think that might help reduce the amount of quick-draw easy-rep answers that you describe).\n\u2013 \nhalfer\nCommented\nMay 6, 2014 at 7:36\n1\n@halfer: Thanks for your support, but I tried to suggest a feature here several times, from a very simple one to a very complex one. None of them were ever implemented, even though a simple one would take like 1hr of development time. Some got upvoted, some got downvoted, but no action taken to date. If interested, see my stackexchange meta account (this is where my suggestions ended up after migration).\n\u2013 \nVictor Zakharov\nCommented\nMay 6, 2014 at 11:23\n1\n@halfer: And yeah, I am not \"operating\" as much as I used to - you can see my profile. Partly because of the broken spirit. I see people still providing good answers, but it's not the same thrill.\n\u2013 \nVictor Zakharov\nCommented\nMay 6, 2014 at 11:25\nSometimes late answers do pay off\n\u2013 \nPeter Mortensen\nCommented\nFeb 2, 2015 at 21:51\n@PeterMortensen: I'm sure one can find some statistics to prove a point that bigger part of reputation comes from \"quick draw\" answers. People often like to use Jon Skeet as an example, so here it goes - 9min accepted answer, 54 upvotes, and btw, this was 2 days ago. Not saying that old school doesn't work, it's just not as efficient to \"farm\" rep.\n\u2013 \nVictor Zakharov\nCommented\nFeb 3, 2015 at 1:56\nYou need to be ahead. Being to be one of the first to read the new questions is a real must have (to answer newer questions on popular tags like python, java, C++, C). That means you have to spend a lot of time on the site, or frequently check new questions all along your day.\nTo be ahead, tune your filters to avoid seeing all questions. You won't be able to follow, and you cannot know all the languages/technologies.\nDon't lose time answering crap questions. A question with a score of -4 is very likely to be closed / ignored. You'll waste your time, and won't even get an acceptance from OP who doesn't have a clue (you might get 1 upvote, maybe or some downvotes). And in the meanwhile, you're missing better questions.\nFor some questions, you have to be a FGITW (be the fastest to answer), but your answer must be spot on. So stay sharp and drink coffee (with a straw so you can keep on typing)\nFor some questions, it's better to comment, ask clarifications, leave other FGITWs answer (and do it wrong because they actually didn't read the comments). While all bad answers are being posted, hone yours, make it better/more detailed/more performant than the others and post it afterwards. The combination of \"a lot of comments\" then \"an answer\" is appreciated by followers, because you took your time before answering properly.\nDon't answer obvious duplicates. Instead, vote to close / hammer them if you can. You'll be punished by some (specially if you have a high reputation) by answering. You should know better. Instead, you can answer the \"original\" question if you feel something is missing. I did that once, and my answer now has a +10 score.\nThere's a \"new answers to old question\" review queue. I think that's where I got my first +1, because I added a above average by answering to an old question and I was a newbie so someone wanted to encourage me.\nOf course if you're a specialist of some obscure/less popular tags (like Ada) you'll get upvotes on older answers by followers of those tags / people who have the \"active\" setting in SO page to see not only new questions, but active ones (which is impossible to follow on the popular tags BTW)\nOnce you posted, edit your answer to add details. If it's already good, you can get upvotes, but enhancing it makes it \"active\" again, and if it's better you may get more upvotes.\nAnswer the comments made on your answers. Some commenters upvote if you answer them (better: edit your answer to take their questions into account if worth it). Plus it means that you care.\nIf you feel it's wrong, delete it, edit it, undelete it. You'll save a stray downvote.\nUpvote concurrent answers if they're good (you'll even get a \"sportsmanship\" silver badge for that eventually). It creates a gap between your score and the other(s) answers, which isn't necessarily bad. Some may even think that yours have not enough votes // the others and that could even play your way (don't do that just to achieve that result, though)\nIf the question is bad, but you still want to help, you can comment on what's wrong. Doesn't hurt, and you'll get known as a nice fellow.\nDon't answer like you would comment. If you don't feel like answering, then don't, and just comment.\nAlso upvote the good questions. That'll make them visible, only if it's worth, not to indirectly promote your answer. A lot of people forget to do that. Good questions need love too.\nMany people are answering their own questions, and approaching SO as a gang sport. Improving the questions, answers and tagging of others is admirable and Socratic, but will not do much for your fantasy social credit nerd score (SO rep).\n\u2013 \nBirkensox\nCommented\nAug 18, 2019 at 21:24\nRegister.\nStart answering.\nNEVER read the question body, but only tags and title\nWrite an answer that just looks like a good one (preferably just copy and paste some code snippet from manual, or other answer, if you want to bring some explanation along), but has no real relation to the problem.\nGet deserved and hard-earned upvotes a ton\nDon't be afraid of getting some downvotes - as long as your answer looks like a good one, the only downvote you can get from someone who have a clue and time to bother, but such people are scarce. Yet for every downvote you will get a comforting upvote - this site is for fun and happiness - remember?\nStart your desired \"activity\" with votes, comments and unicorns. That's the real fun and purpose of this site.\nI can't tell if this is a \"good\" answer or a \"bad\" answer. It has elements of both :P Also, why so much hate for this one user?\n\u2013 \nuser456814\nCommented\nMay 9, 2014 at 8:36\n14\nThis is called \"sarcasm\".\n\u2013 \nYour Common Sense\nCommented\nMay 9, 2014 at 8:36\n9\nI'm fully aware that it's sarcastic, I'm just not sure how helpful that is :/\n\u2013 \nuser456814\nCommented\nMay 9, 2014 at 8:37\n1\nSurely this answer is bad, or even evil, as it is not about happiness and unicorns and contains no funny image. And it hurts reader's feelings, which is the deadliest sin on Stack Overflow\n\u2013 \nYour Common Sense\nCommented\nMay 9, 2014 at 8:51\n6\nWould you like to make use of the rant tag? Or perhaps a [troll] tag? ;) Or perhaps the mad-as-hell tag :)\n\u2013 \nuser456814\nCommented\nMay 9, 2014 at 8:53\n3\nI would rather prefer to make use of common-sense tag, which usually doesn't require such explicit tagging at all.\n\u2013 \nYour Common Sense\nCommented\nMay 9, 2014 at 9:01\n6\n\"Surely this answer is bad, or even evil, as it is not about happiness and unicorns and contains no funny image. And it hurts reader's feelings, which is the deadliest sin on Stack Overflow \" - so you've finally decided to switch the sarcasm off then, and make a stark realisation. Good stuff. Sarcasm isn't usually a very effective medium on the internet, BTW, and not usually deemed helpful in any culture anywhere. If you genuinely don't realise you're a troll, let me clear that up for you; you are.\n\u2013 \nFelix Weelix\nCommented\nMar 13, 2015 at 17:29\nIf someone answers well regarding a piece of code, but you realise that what you posted was a much simpler version of what you're actually attempting, and you now want active help for your HARDER piece of code, just post another question instead of editing your old one. It's not cheating! Someone told me this and said my EDIT was a completely different question, and more people would notice it if I dedicated it to a new question.\nIf programming, then post your precise error - it's easy to do, and it's really hard to get any sympathy without it.\nBe concise with your English. It makes a difference: e.g, 'it is important to note that I have already tried X, Y, and Z' could be said as 'I have already tried X, Y and Z'. Or, 'overly complicated' could be said as 'too complicated'.\nAlso, don't include anything that DOESN'T help people answer your question. For example, backstory. No-one cares. This is an exaggeration, but e.g, 'I've been doing this really hard project at this workshop with an old version of X and we're not allowed to use imported modules for some reason, other than X, and it's taken me ages and I feel like I'm missing something totally obvious; lots of people I know seem to have managed it just fine, but by the way, I was never quite sure if it would be better to do X, Y, Z' will probably alienate your audience. Also, don't say 'I'm really a beginner, I only started python X months ago', because you may as well say 'I don't know anything, I'm so sorry, I'm completely wasting your time'. It's not going to make people answer your question any better.\n8\nI'm trying to decide how much of this answer is sincere and how much of it is sarcasm...\n\u2013 \nuser247702\nCommented\nFeb 27, 2017 at 22:11\n5\n@Stijn Halfway through reading the answer I was convinced it was entirely sarcastic. Having reached the end, and then looked through the author's post history a bit, I'm sad to say I think it is the opposite. I think that's worse, although that's hard to say.\n\u2013 \nServy\nCommented\nFeb 27, 2017 at 22:12\nSorry guys; my wording was a bit over-the-top so I've toned it down. I don't mean to come across as sad/green/naive, even though I do, and I don't do sarcasm because it's really hard to convey tone-of-voice across the internet. Yes, I really believe everything I said! That's only SLIGHTLY worse than if it had all been sarcastic, @Servy. I wouldn't post an answer that DELIBERATELY acquires 9 downvotes! In my opinion, the original question was good, and my answer wasn't THAT bad.\n\u2013 \nParallax Sugar\nCommented\nFeb 27, 2017 at 22:42\n5\n@LauraCookson Your answer is pretty bad. This is all awful advice. The problem isn't how you worded the suggestions, the problem is that all of the suggestions are inherently bad things to do.\n\u2013 \nServy\nCommented\nFeb 27, 2017 at 22:47\n1\nI'm only going to \"nag,\" for lack of a better term, on one point for the moment for lack of time: For your point 1, that's completely opposite of the current community guidelines. That would be unnecessary noise that is not at all crucial to your question. Yes, you're grateful. Yes, you're trying to be polite... We do that kind of thing with upvotes and accept votes around here. See meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2950/\u2026 on MSE for more info.\n\u2013 \nKendra\nCommented\nFeb 27, 2017 at 22:48\n2\nI lied, I'll touch on point two as well. Your questions and their answers aren't just for you, they're for everyone who comes to the site later to look for a solution to the same problem. If you lie about what worked for you, you may very well end up creating confusion and frustration for someone down the line who finds your post and tries what you said was a \"helpful\" answer when you really feel the suggestion does not help at all.\n\u2013 \nKendra\nCommented\nFeb 27, 2017 at 22:51\nFair enough. If I deleted the answer, would it get rid of the bad impression I've just left? Is that bad practice? That was my first answer, so I'm not that surprised that it was terrible. Ok, I am, but only a little.\n\u2013 \nParallax Sugar\nCommented\nFeb 27, 2017 at 22:51\n2\nDeleting a badly received answer is an OK thing to do. (You'll even get a badge!) Don't worry too much about the impression though. We vote on the content of a post, not on the person who posted it.\n\u2013 \nuser247702\nCommented\nFeb 27, 2017 at 22:53\n1\nWell, keep in mind that anyone with 10k rep will still be able to see anything you delete here- Nothing is ever deleted deleted, just soft deleted. Also keep in mind that on Meta, votes do not affect your rep. So if the negative \"rep\" is what you mean by that \"bad impression,\" it won't actually affect anything. Cleaning up bad or incorrect answers is never a bad idea. You may decide to leave it up to show what not to do in this case, if you wish, or you may decide to research what was wrong with your points and explain why they're wrong. That's up to you.\n\u2013 \nKendra\nCommented\nFeb 27, 2017 at 22:54\nAs a side note, I do encourage you to try to look into your points and see where the community feels you're wrong. You can learn a lot about the site that you never knew this way. :)\n\u2013 \nKendra\nCommented\nFeb 27, 2017 at 22:57\n2\nThanks @Kendra. I left up the bad advice and tried to add new, good advice. It can't be worse than my old advice.\n\u2013 \nParallax Sugar\nCommented\nFeb 27, 2017 at 23:23\n2\nYour answer looks a lot better, Laura! I reversed my vote. This is a much more useful answer now. :)\n\u2013 \nKendra\nCommented\nFeb 28, 2017 at 14:22\n5\nA thoughtful downvote because while overall I cannot but agree with you, your overal tone is ... not very constructive. In my opinion it is the moderation that makes Stack Exchange sites better than your average discussion forum. \"Questions and answers, no chitchat\" and stuff like that -- a good thing. Calling the people who attempt to keep the quality high \"elitists\" is not a good thing.\n\u2013 \nJongware\nCommented\nNov 10, 2018 at 9:58\n@usr2564301 I'm not calling them elitists because they attempt to keep the quality high. I was suggesting reviewing content such sergworks.wordpress.com/2012/09/26/why-stackoverflow-sucks before deciding weather you want to be part of the community or not.\n\u2013 \nuser10367961\nCommented\nNov 10, 2018 at 10:57\n@usr2564301 The elitists also don't seem to be very concerned with moderating the content of their own. See stackoverflow.com/users/1505120/pnuts for a concrete example. Seems like from a certain rep count on, the quality standards become irrelevant and you are no longer subject to moderation.\n\u2013 \nuser10367961\nCommented\nNov 10, 2018 at 11:00\n4\nI neither see the point of linking to a certain profile (because I do not see whether something is wrong with that), nor of linking to an 8 year old blog post, nor of raising the question of \"why?\". But honestly, I never understood the question here in the first place. I just wrote some answers where I (thought that) I could make valuable contributions, and ... there we go. Started. That's it. Why? I have no idea. Hubris, probably.\n\u2013 \nMarco13\nCommented\nNov 10, 2018 at 17:23\n@Marco13 And that's ok.

If it's \"hard\" to figure out a question to ask, that must mean that you can find an answer to most (if not all) of your problems here. Isn't that a good thing? I suppose trying to answer other people's questions is a decent way to contribute (and gain rep, if that is important). Personally I quickly found I don't really have the patience, as the quality of the questions on the tags I follow are generally quite low, but if you have the patience for it then I would say go for it. Gaining rep isn't the ultimate purpose here though.\nCommented\nApr 30, 2014 at 20:59\nCommented\nApr 30, 2014 at 20:59\n12\nOne frustrating thing is, that I cannot even upvote stuff on other StackExchange-sites, even if I've been active on this particular site.

That'd take care of your upvote problem.\nCommented\nMay 5, 2014 at 19:01\nCommented\nMay 5, 2014 at 19:01\n7\nI don't know about the West Coast of the US, but over here one's reputation on Stack Overflow carries about as much weight as the number of neighbours you have in Farmville.

Most of the good questions will be duplicates, meaning it's rare to get points for asking, and answering will require some combination of speed, writing skills, and specialized knowledge. Speed and writing skills can come with practice, but if you're already discouraged you're unlikely to practice.\nCommented\nMay 7, 2014 at 15:55\nCommented\nMay 7, 2014 at 15:55\n1\n@MarkRansom F-3000 I know it's tough on SO these days. You missed the any site part. On the contrary, little of my rep is from new questions; two populists, a dozen necromancers, and half as many revivals that say speed has nothing to do with it.

Thus you can at least upvote. Obviosly you should register to SE-sites that you're interested in and at least check out once in a while.

After this, some users will view your profile, and will increase drastically your reputation (consequences of more votes for the questions you've made in the past) if you made a good answer that have not enough views to improve your rep.

To gain reputation fast you have to look for soft questions and answer them quickly. If the OP recognizes your work is +25 points (answer + upvote, typically). I've been scanning the homepage for hours in order to find the right question and quickly provide the answer and that's how you do gain rep points in SO, sad but true. I've been doing loads of edits as well (fair +2). Also, not surprisingly, some more appropriate answers to heavy subjects (e.g. machine learning) didn't get the attention they deserve.\nCommented\nMar 4, 2016 at 21:15\nCommented\nMar 4, 2016 at 21:15\nMay 23, 2017 at 12:38\nBot\n1\nApr 25, 2014 at 13:59\nMod\n407k\n46\n46\n46 gold badges\n292\n292\n292 silver badges\n309\n309\n309 bronze badges\n5\nMany thanks.

Somebody better versed with MATLAB and other tools can calculate correlation matrices, do cluster analysis and such, based on real Q/A data from different users. But I am mostly sure they will come up to the same ideas. Why it works like that - is another story. Regarding your \"great answer several days later\" example, a proof link would help.

To maximize your tax return, you can use numerous loop holes in the tax system. The more successful businessman you are, the more loop holes you know, or so does your accountant. And while this behavior is certainly not encouraged by government, it was, is, and will be the best way to keep money in your pocket, with taxes normally eating >50% of your income. Now the question is, if you know such a loop hole, would you use it yourself?

Heh, I smiled at your tax example, but I don't think it is a good analogy for reputation on the site. There's no limited supply of \"money\" and it cannot be \"spent\", so why hoard it?

Welcome. Previous post (#0): Stack Overflow: A Technical Deconstruction Next post (#2): Stack Overflow: The Hardware - 2016 Edition\nTo get an idea of what all of this stuff \u201cdoes,\u201d let me start off with an update on the average day at Stack Overflow. So you can compare to the previous numbers from November 2013, here\u2019s a day of statistics from February 9th, 2016 with differences since November 12th, 2013:\nYou may be wondering about the drastic ASP.Net reduction in processing time compared to 2013 (which was 757 hours) despite 61 million more requests a day. That\u2019s due to both a hardware upgrade in early 2015 as well as a lot of performance tuning inside the applications themselves. Please don\u2019t forget: performance is still a feature. If you\u2019re curious about more hardware specifics than I\u2019m about to provide\u2014fear not. The next post will be an appendix with detailed hardware specs for all of the servers that run the sites (I\u2019ll update this with a link when it\u2019s live).\nSo what\u2019s changed in the last 2 years? Besides replacing some servers and network gear, not much. Here\u2019s a top-level list of hardware that runs the sites today (noting what\u2019s different since 2013):\nWhat do we need to run Stack Overflow? That hasn\u2019t changed much since 2013, but due to the optimizations and new hardware mentioned above, we\u2019re down to needing only 1 web server. We have unintentionally tested this, successfully, a few times. To be clear: I\u2019m saying it works. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a good idea. It\u2019s fun though, every time.\nNow that we have some baseline numbers for an idea of scale, let\u2019s see how we make those fancy web pages. Since few systems exist in complete isolation (and ours is no exception), architecture decisions often make far less sense without a bigger picture of how those pieces fit into the whole. That\u2019s the goal here, to cover the big picture. Many subsequent posts will do deep dives into specific areas. This will be a logistical overview with hardware highlights only; the next post will have the hardware details.\nFor those of you here to see what the hardware looks like these days, here are a few pictures I took of rack A (it has a matching sister rack B) during our February 2015 upgrade:\n\u2026and if you\u2019re into that kind of thing, here\u2019s the entire 256 image album from that week (you\u2019re damn right that number\u2019s intentional). Now, let\u2019s dig into layout. Here\u2019s a logical overview of the major systems in play:\nHere are some rules that apply globally so I don\u2019t have to repeat them with every setup:\nFirst, you have to find us\u2014that\u2019s DNS. Finding us needs to be fast, so we farm this out to CloudFlare (currently) because they have DNS servers nearer to almost everyone around the world. We update our DNS records via an API and they do the \u201chosting\u201d of DNS. But since we\u2019re jerks with deeply-rooted trust issues, we still have our own DNS servers as well. Should the apocalypse happen (probably caused by the GPL, Punyon, or caching) and people still want to program to take their mind off of it, we\u2019ll flip them on.\nAfter you find our secret hideout, HTTP traffic comes from one of our four ISPs (Level 3, Zayo, Cogent, and Lightower in New York) and flows through one of our four edge routers. We peer with our ISPs using BGP (fairly standard) in order to control the flow of traffic and provide several avenues for traffic to reach us most efficiently. These ASR-1001 and ASR-1001-X routers are in 2 pairs, each servicing 2 ISPs in active/active fashion\u2014so we\u2019re redundant here. Though they\u2019re all on the same physical 10Gbps network, external traffic is in separate isolated external VLANs which the load balancers are connected to as well. After flowing through the routers, you\u2019re headed for a load balancer.\nI suppose this may be a good time to mention we have a 10Gbps MPLS between our 2 data centers, but it is not directly involved in serving the sites. We use this for data replication and quick recovery in the cases where we need a burst. \u201cBut Nick, that\u2019s not redundant!\u201d Well, you\u2019re technically correct (the best kind of correct), that\u2019s a single point of failure on its face. But wait! We maintain 2 more failover OSPF routes (the MPLS is #1, these are #2 and 3 by cost) via our ISPs. Each of the sets mentioned earlier connects to the corresponding set in Colorado, and they load balance traffic between in the failover situation. We could make both sets connect to both sets and have 4 paths but, well, whatever. Moving on.\nThe load balancers are running HAProxy 1.5.15 on CentOS 7, our preferred flavor of Linux. TLS (SSL) traffic is also terminated in HAProxy. We\u2019ll be looking hard at HAProxy 1.7 soon for HTTP/2 support.\nUnlike all other servers with a dual 10Gbps LACP network link, each load balancer has 2 pairs of 10Gbps: one for the external network and one for the DMZ. These boxes run 64GB or more of memory to more efficiently handle SSL negotiation. When we can cache more TLS sessions in memory for reuse, there\u2019s less to recompute on subsequent connections to the same client. This means we can resume sessions both faster and cheaper. Given that RAM is pretty cheap dollar-wise, it\u2019s an easy choice.\nThe load balancers themselves are a pretty simple setup. We listen to different sites on various IPs (mostly for certificate concerns and DNS management) and route to various backends based mostly on the host header. The only things of note we do here is rate limiting and some header captures (sent from our web tier) into the HAProxy syslog message so we can record performance metrics for every single request. We\u2019ll cover that later too.\nThe load balancers feed traffic to 9 servers we refer to as \u201cprimary\u201d (01-09) and 2 \u201cdev/meta\u201d (10-11, our staging environment) web servers. The primary servers run things like Stack Overflow, Careers, and all Stack Exchange sites except meta.stackoverflow.com and meta.stackexchange.com, which run on the last 2 servers. The primary Q&A Application itself is multi-tenant. This means that a single application serves the requests for all Q&A sites. Put another way: we can run the entire Q&A network off of a single application pool on a single server. Other applications like Careers, API v2, Mobile API, etc. are separate. Here\u2019s what the primary and dev tiers look like in IIS:\nHere\u2019s what Stack Overflow\u2019s distribution across the web tier looks like in Opserver (our internal monitoring dashboard):\n\u2026and here\u2019s what those web servers look like from a utilization perspective:\nI\u2019ll go into why we\u2019re so overprovisioned in future posts, but the highlight items are: rolling builds, headroom, and redundancy.\nBehind those web servers is the very similar \u201cservice tier.\u201d It\u2019s also running IIS 8.5 on Windows 2012R2. This tier runs internal services to support the production web tier and other internal systems. The two big players here are \u201cStack Server\u201d which runs the tag engine and is based on http.sys (not behind IIS) and the Providence API (IIS-based). Fun fact: I have to set affinity on each of these 2 processes to land on separate sockets because Stack Server just steamrolls the L2 and L3 cache when refreshing question lists on a 2-minute interval.\nThese service boxes do heavy lifting with the tag engine and backend APIs where we need redundancy, but not 9x redundancy. For example, loading all of the posts and their tags that change every n minutes from the database (currently 2) isn\u2019t that cheap. We don\u2019t want to do that load 9 times on the web tier; 3 times is enough and gives us enough safety. We also configure these boxes differently on the hardware side to be better optimized for the different computational load characteristics of the tag engine and elastic indexing jobs (which also run here). The \u201ctag engine\u201d is a relatively complicated topic in itself and will be a dedicated post. The basics are: when you visit /questions/tagged/java, you\u2019re hitting the tag engine to see which questions match. It does all of our tag matching outside of /search, so the new navigation, etc. are all using this service for data.\nWe use Redis for a few things here and it\u2019s rock solid. Despite doing about 160 billion ops a month, every instance is below 2% CPU. Usually much lower:\nWe have an L1/L2 cache system with Redis. \u201cL1\u201d is HTTP Cache on the web servers or whatever application is in play. \u201cL2\u201d is falling back to Redis and fetching the value out. Our values are stored in the Protobuf format, via protobuf-dot-net by Marc Gravell. For a client, we\u2019re using StackExchange.Redis\u2014written in-house and open source. When one web server gets a cache miss in both L1 and L2, it fetches the value from source (a database query, API call, etc.) and puts the result in both local cache and Redis. The next server wanting the value may miss L1, but would find the value in L2/Redis, saving a database query or API call.\nWe also run many Q&A sites, so each site has its own L1/L2 caching: by key prefix in L1 and by database ID in L2/Redis. We\u2019ll go deeper on this in a future post.\nAlongside the 2 main Redis servers (master/slave) that run all the site instances, we also have a machine learning instance slaved across 2 more dedicated servers (due to memory). This is used for recommending questions on the home page, better matching to jobs, etc. It\u2019s a platform called Providence, covered by Kevin Montrose here.\nThe main Redis servers have 256GB of RAM (about 90GB in use) and the Providence servers have 384GB of RAM (about 125GB in use).\nRedis isn\u2019t just for cache though, it also has a publish & subscriber mechanism where one server can publish a message and all other subscribers receive it\u2014including downstream clients on Redis slaves. We use this mechanism to clear L1 caches on other servers when one web server does a removal for consistency, but there\u2019s another great use: websockets.\nWe use websockets to push real-time updates to users such as notifications in the top bar, vote counts, new nav counts, new answers and comments, and a few other bits.\nThe socket servers themselves are using raw sockets running on the web tier. It\u2019s a very thin application on top of our open source library: StackExchange.NetGain. During peak, we have about 500,000 concurrent websocket connections open. That\u2019s a lot of browsers. Fun fact: some of those browsers have been open for over 18 months. We\u2019re not sure why. Someone should go check if those developers are still alive. Here\u2019s what this week\u2019s concurrent websocket pattern looks like:\nWhy websockets? They\u2019re tremendously more efficient than polling at our scale. We can simply push more data with fewer resources this way, while being more instant to the user. They\u2019re not without issues though\u2014ephemeral port and file handle exhaustion on the load balancer are fun issues we\u2019ll cover later.\nSpoiler: there\u2019s not a lot to get excited about here. The web tier is doing pretty vanilla searches against Elasticsearch 1.4, using the very slim high-performance StackExchange.Elastic client. Unlike most things, we have no plans to open source this simply because it only exposes a very slim subset of the API we use. I strongly believe releasing it would do more harm than good with developer confusion. We\u2019re using elastic for /search, calculating related questions, and suggestions when asking a question.\nEach Elastic cluster (there\u2019s one in each data center) has 3 nodes, and each site has its own index. Careers has an additional few indexes. What makes our setup a little non-standard in the elastic world: our 3 server clusters are a bit beefier than average with all SSD storage, 192GB of RAM, and dual 10Gbps network each.\nThe same application domains (yeah, we\u2019re screwed with .Net Core here\u2026) in Stack Server that host the tag engine also continually index items in Elasticsearch. We do some simple tricks here such as ROWVERSION in SQL Server (the data source) compared against a \u201clast position\u201d document in Elastic. Since it behaves like a sequence, we can simply grab and index any items that have changed since the last pass.\nThe main reason we\u2019re on Elasticsearch instead of something like SQL full-text search is scalability and better allocation of money. SQL CPUs are comparatively very expensive, Elastic is cheap and has far more features these days. Why not Solr? We want to search across the entire network (many indexes at once), and this wasn\u2019t supported at decision time. The reason we\u2019re not on 2.x yet is a major change to \u201ctypes\u201d means we need to reindex everything to upgrade. I just don\u2019t have enough time to make the needed changes and migration plan yet.\nWe\u2019re using SQL Server as our single source of truth. All data in Elastic and Redis comes from SQL Server. We run 2 SQL Server clusters with AlwaysOn Availability Groups. Each of these clusters has 1 master (taking almost all of the load) and 1 replica in New York. Additionally, they have 1 replica in Colorado (our DR data center). All replicas are asynchronous.\nThe first cluster is a set of Dell R720xd servers, each with 384GB of RAM, 4TB of PCIe SSD space, and 2x 12 cores. It hosts the Stack Overflow, Sites (bad name, I\u2019ll explain later), PRIZM, and Mobile databases.\nThe second cluster is a set of Dell R730xd servers, each with 768GB of RAM, 6TB of PCIe SSD space, and 2x 8 cores. This cluster runs everything else. That list includes Talent, Open ID, Chat, our Exception log, and every other Q&A site (e.g. Super User, Server Fault, etc.).\nCPU utilization on the database tier is something we like to keep very low, but it\u2019s actually a little high at the moment due to some plan cache issues we\u2019re addressing. As of right now, NY-SQL02 and 04 are masters, 01 and 03 are replicas we just restarted today during some SSD upgrades. Here\u2019s what the past 24 hours looks like:\nOur usage of SQL is pretty simple. Simple is fast. Though some queries can be crazy, our interaction with SQL itself is fairly vanilla. We have some legacy Linq2Sql, but all new development is using Dapper, our open source Micro-ORM using POCOs. Let me put this another way: Stack Overflow has only 1 stored procedure in the database and I intend to move that last vestige into code.\nOkay, let\u2019s change gears to something that can more directly help you. I\u2019ve mentioned a few of these up above, but I\u2019ll provide a list here of many open-source .Net libraries we maintain for the world to use. We open sourced them because they have no core business value but can help the world of developers. I hope you find these useful today:\nNext up is a detailed current hardware list of what runs our code. After that, we go down the list.

I guess this would require just ten more seconds from all of us. Sometimes I reformat others' questions to make them nicer to read.\nI know this topic is subjective and surely there are people who don't care about it. But I tend to be very finicky and I like well formatted questions and answers. I know that the content I submit is far from perfect\u2014I'm not a native English speaker, but I try my best.\nWhich typography glitches do you edit in questions or answers of other users? What are the most annoying style mistakes? Do you have some general layout advice?\nWhen you have decided that you need to ask your question, first you should do a thorough search on Stack Overflow to see if this question has been asked beforehand. Also, when typing a new question title in the 'Ask Question', similar titles will appear beneath it, and some questions may be very similar or even identical to yours.\nSo, if you find a question that is very similar to yours that has already been asked beforehand, do not post your question...for the simple reason that it will be [closed] for being an [exact duplicate].\nThen, if you don't find an already-existent answer to your query, you must ask yourself one question before ultimately deciding whether or not to post your question:\nIs my question here on Stack Overflow programing related?\nIf the answer to the above question is a no (because it only talks about hardware specifications for example), then you shouldn't post your question; reason being that, as I mentioned earlier on, it will be closed as soon as anyone above with 3K reputation points notices it.\nThe name of the question is the gateway to your question. You have to make it descriptive enough to specify your problem, but not too long that it becomes almost part of your question text.\nIn the title, also mention what technology, language or anything that your question is related to. For example, a title like Structuring my code won't immediately tell the people what you are referring to exactly, but something like Structuring my code in C# will give a much clearer view of what you will be talking about.\nWith that said, don't use titles such as Why is this not working?, or Help me with this please!!.\nOh and speaking of which, One question mark is enough\n...don't do this: What are closures???\nAnd guys, in the English Language, the first letter of a sentence is always capitalized, so apply this concept to you question title (and also to the whole text of the question).\nIf you really can't find an answer to your query elsewhere, then open your favorite text editor, and start typing in your question. Why use a text editor and not Stack Overflow's editor? Well, you don't want to submit your question by mistake before it's complete, eh....\nSo when you finish writing your question, read it and correct the typos (use a spellchecker). After that, read it more carefully and correct the remaining typos once more. When you're done with the typos, check that the technical information you are asking about is correct.\nWhen you are finished, paste your answer in the Stack Overflow editor. But the question is not ready for submission just yet.\nIf possible, highlight your question (ending with a question mark [?]) in bold. This is so that your question stands out in your post, more than the rest of the text.\nSplit your post into paragraphs.\nThis is a very important point, and I encounter and edit a lot of posts that look like a square (of text). Don't forget that most people scan your question, not study it, so you need to split it into multiple paragraphs, so it'll be much easier on the eyes, and much more clarified.\nNow, you need to, most importantly, use the Code Sample format button ({}) for code pasting. There is nothing more frustrating than trying to read code that is not formatted accordingly, especially in such a compact space.\nConsider the following unformatted piece of code (JavaScript):\nvar aFunction = function () { var num = 9; return function () { return num += 2; }; }();\nNow, take a look at the same piece of code, this time using the Code Sample formatting:\nTake a guess as to which piece of code people will most likely understand?\nWhen you ultimately post your question and receive answers, if one of the answers actually answers your question, mark it as answered, and this is so that (apart from the fact that the posted gets awarded for the correct answer) people will know which answer to look for if they want to see the solution to the posted question.\nSo you see, constructing and posting a question requires some time and effort, but that time and effort you spend will result in people answering your question as intelligently as you posted your question.\nSo, just a small recap of what was said here:\nThere is a lot more to be said here, but the above points just came from the top of my head, and from my little experience here at Stack Overflow.\nAs an example (real question on Stack Overflow):\nBefore:\nHi, i'm beginner in java,i'm reading data from port thr serail port,i got serialPort.setSerialPortParams(9600, SerialPort.DATABITS_ 8, SerialPort.STOPBITS_ 1, SerialPort.PARITY_ NONE); what is the meaning of 9600,DATABITS_8,STOPBITS_1 AND PARITY_NONE.\nAfter:\nHi, I'm a beginner in Java. I'm reading data from the serial port. I got\nWhat is the meaning of 9600, DATABITS_8,STOPBITS_1 and PARITY_NONE?\nI changed following things here:\nI'll edit spelling mistakes, poor grammar, poor formatting (lists, code blocks), poor titles... just about anything really, as long as I'm not changing what the question is about.\nWhen closing a question as a duplicate I've noticed a few styles, but I don't edit these:\nI also (almost) never edit answers - I'll leave a comment instead.\nJust out of interest, are you a writer for The Sun? :)\nSome things to do and to not do.\nDon't begin an answer with \"as others have said\". Each answer is independent. And independently voted up or down -- there's no inherent order to the answers. If yours is good, but entered later, it will be voted up leading to the curious problem of the top answer referencing lower-ranked answers.\nPlease quote the other answers\nOr link to the other answers.\nDon't QFT another answer. Quoting for Truth leads to duplicate answers.\nDon't expand your question via an answer. If you want to respond to an answer, either\nComment on the answer\nUpdate your question\nThis is not threaded email -- the order of the questions and answers changes. Your non-answer will get down-voted, fall to the bottom and disappear.\nMost any editing is fair game though you should try to respect the original author's style choices lest you spark an edit war over brace style or something. :) Also, be conservative about edits that clarify questions since you could inadvertently make some of the answers sound stupid or pedantic or confused or such. When in doubt I'll add an explicit \"ADDED:\" to the question so it's clear that the answerers may not have seen the addendum. On the other hand, Stack Overflow questions are meant to be like a definitive collection of mini-essays on a topic for posterity, so don't try to maintain a strictly faithful dialog either. Save that for the comments (which are also helpful to alert answerers to changes in the question).\nThe brace style edit war was hypothetical (I hope), but here's a contentious answer to your question about what edits are annoying: I find it annoying when people contort question titles to be in the form of a question. Like \"How can I create a regular expression to parse names?\" instead of just \"Regular expressions to parse names.\" Get rid of the filler words in the title to make more room for keywords (perhaps \"Regular expression to parse out first and last names.\"). It's still clear that you're asking how to create said regular expression, and you can use the body of the question to make the actual question more explicit.\nI think it's important for a post on Style to let people know that there is a special help page for Markdown syntax.\nHere I describe my answer style that has gradually evolved trough the years. I decided to write it down as it solidified and as I noticed some patterns.\nMarkdown generics\nI use my style guide described at: http://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/ It is too long to reproduce here. This guide will focus only on SO specifics.\nUse bold for title-like structs\nE.g.:\nDon't use headers as they are too large, and don't generate any link IDs anyways...\nDon't use bold anywhere else, otherwise readers will have a time finding the subsection titles.\nStart every answer with a title\nSummarizing the key part of the answer:\nTheory and experiment\nThe perfect answer often contains both:\nexperiments: concrete examples you have run to verify that you understood the theory\ntheory: for most programming questions, this means a quote from canonical standards, documentation, or source code\nProvide the exact version of the documentation, ideally with a link to it, and quote the most relevant paragraphs in the answer.\nThe experiment should come first, that is the better way to teach something to humans.\nExtremely concrete experiments\nIf the answer contains an experiment, provide:\nand only then start explaining why the expected output happened.\nTested with\nIf you did any experiments, add a \"Tested with:\" section at the end of your answer, so that others will know how to reproduce your results.\nThis should include:\nyour distro version\nthe version of key utilities used in the answer\nWhile this is implied from Ubuntu version for example, it still saves readers some time.\nE.g.:\nIt is true that Ubuntu patchlevel versions e.g. 18.04.2 may change those versions further, and you can also get even more precise package information from dpkg -l e.g.:\nbut I think it is reasonable to omit this level of detail as it is likely too much for most users.\nIf you have tested different sections with different OSes, add the tested with line for each section instead of at the end of the answer.\nCode\nAdd a colon to the previous paragraph of every code block or terminal excerpt:\nIf your reference code is:\nmedium sized, inline it and also add it to your GitHub / GitLab / etc. and link to it to properly version control the code and review pull requests.\nE.g., link to your GitHub upstream after the code as:\nvery large: omit it from the answer, and just link to upstream.\nStack Overflow has a 30k character answer size limit, so that is an absolute upper limit.\nFiles\nRepresent files and their names as:\nThe most important file of each example should be called main.extension, e.g. main.c, unless there is a more important convention on the language, e.g. index.html.\nImages\nIf input / output images are involved in the answer, provide them.\nRelevant images are fun and intuitive!\nVideos are also good! They can be represented with GIFs, see:\nIf a diagram would help, also consider some ASCII art.\nStandard quotes\nLike this:\nSo note:\nIntersperse paragraphs with lists, code blocks and other block elements\nHaving a huge sequence of plain paragraphs, or God forbid, one huge paragraph, makes text very boring to look at.\nInstead, intersperse block elements throughout your text.\nThis just makes everything more pleasing to look at, and easier for the eye to know where you are.\nFor example, instead of creating a list in a paragraph as in:\ncould be used to add a block element as:\nFor the same reason, every code block that is more than one word can be used as a block rather than inline if you feel that a block would look nice.\nBeautiful text is not just text. Beautiful text is half text, and half ASCII art. There is almost a texture, or tempo, to it.\nQuestion title style guide\nI have summarized my recommended question title style at: How do I write a good title?\nStart asking to get answers\nFind the answer to your question by asking.\nExplore related questions\nSee similar questions with these tags.\nSite design / logo \u00a9 2025 Stack Exchange Inc; user contributions licensed under CC BY-SA . rev 2025.7.31.32357\ndiscussion\nstack-overflow\nedits\nmarkdown\nlow-quality-posts\n1\nIs this a question about style guidelines for for authors, or for editors?\n\u2013 \neinpoklum\nCommented\nOct 20, 2019 at 14:38\n2\nI found this question searching for stack overflow style guide.

As a new editor I think that would be great. I've been trawling SE for 9 years and the variation between formatting standards is maddening. Braces/spaces might be an exception but I think a brief style guide would have massive impact on the readability of questions and the amount & volume of editing (hopefully reducing them).

I.e., not niche audiences.\nI'd say that platforms like Facebook Groups , Reddit , and Discord are popular choices. Each offers unique features to take care of different types of communities. Facebook Groups provides a familiar environment for engaging different audiences, while Reddit offers specialized communities for numerous interests and topics. Discord, known for its real-time communication features, is better for those interactive communities. Choosing the right platform depends on the nature of the community, so exploring their features can help pick the best fit.\nIf you have the resources to manage and direct users to a Discord server , then I'd say that offers the best community experience and flexibility. However, it comes at the cost of discoverability being pretty poor, so you would have to already have an established presence and would need to direct members to join the server from an existing platform.\nI'd say twitter offers a good mix of community engagement and interaction opportunities with the reply and comment sections being pretty robust. You don't get as much flexibility as discord in terms of interaction and communication, but your discoverability potential is much higher (if that's something you're looking for)\nReddit is also an option, and so are Facebook groups, but I have no experience in these spaces compared to running twitters and discords. I think it just depends how real-time you want your community interaction to be.\ncircle and geneva are good\nFacebook groups\nSkools worth a look. I doubt it\u2019s the best at anything yet though\nDiscord and Telegram\nTelegram for me too. I have been building a community on Telegram for a few months now. It works faster compared to Facebook groups and is more interactive\nSkool! I have a subreddit about it and you\u2019re invited to share your journey there too! \ud83d\ude0a\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\nWhat are the best SEO communities / forums nowadays?\nr/SEO\n\u2022\n2 yr. ago\nWhat are the best SEO communities / forums nowadays?\n14 upvotes \u00b7 34 comments\nStaying with trends, what platform do you use?\nr/DigitalMarketing\n\u2022\n3 mo. ago\nStaying with trends, what platform do you use?\n6 upvotes \u00b7 25 comments\nHow do people display their social media platform on their page?\nr/neocities\n\u2022\n7 mo. ago\nHow do people display their social media platform on their page?\n81 upvotes \u00b7 17 comments\nWhat\u2019s the best influencer marketing platform\nr/SaaS\n\u2022\n2 mo. ago\nWhat\u2019s the best influencer marketing platform\n5 upvotes \u00b7 35 comments\nWhat are the best social platforms to build an audience for podcast?\nr/podcasting\n\u2022\n1 yr. ago\nWhat are the best social platforms to build an audience for podcast?\n19 upvotes \u00b7 51 comments\nSeeking recommendations: Which social media tool works best for increasing followers?\nr/DigitalMarketing\n\u2022\n5 mo. ago\nSeeking recommendations: Which social media tool works best for increasing followers?\n12 upvotes \u00b7 40 comments\nWhat is the most interesting digital marketing trend currently?\nr/DigitalMarketing\n\u2022\n1 mo. ago\nWhat is the most interesting digital marketing trend currently?\n7 upvotes \u00b7 25 comments\nWhat is the best social media platform for writers?\nr/DigitalMarketing\n\u2022\n16 days ago\nWhat is the best social media platform for writers?\n8 upvotes \u00b7 14 comments\nWhat marketing communities are you part of?\nr/marketing\n\u2022\n7 mo. ago\nWhat marketing communities are you part of?\n42 upvotes \u00b7 72 comments\nWhich Social Media Management Tools do you recommend?\nr/DigitalMarketing\n\u2022\n6 mo. ago\nWhich Social Media Management Tools do you recommend?\n28 upvotes \u00b7 51 comments\nWhat\u2019s your favorite free tool for managing social media campaigns?\nr/DigitalMarketing\n\u2022\n9 mo. ago\nWhat\u2019s your favorite free tool for managing social media campaigns?\n12 upvotes \u00b7 34 comments\nLooking for help social media marketing for construction business startup\nr/DigitalMarketing\n\u2022\n3 mo. ago\nLooking for help social media marketing for construction business startup\n14 upvotes \u00b7 34 comments\nHello , I am new to digital marketing so where should I start ?\nr/DigitalMarketing\n\u2022\n23 days ago\nHello , I am new to digital marketing so where should I start ?\n51 upvotes \u00b7 107 comments\nHow to Build a Successful Online Business and Find Customers from Day One\nr/DigitalMarketing\n\u2022\n14 days ago\nHow to Build a Successful Online Business and Find Customers from Day One\n7 upvotes \u00b7 4 comments\nThinking of starting my own media agency, what services are most in demand right now?\nr/DigitalMarketing\n\u2022\n4 days ago\nThinking of starting my own media agency, what services are most in demand right now?\n22 upvotes \u00b7 46 comments\nLooking for advice on starting a Social Media Management agency\nr/SocialMediaManagers\n\u2022\n9 days ago\nLooking for advice on starting a Social Media Management agency\n19 upvotes \u00b7 14 comments\nHow do I build a solid digital marketing portfolio?\nr/DigitalMarketing\n\u2022\n11 days ago\nHow do I build a solid digital marketing portfolio?\n5 upvotes \u00b7 20 comments\nWhat\u2019s ACTUALLY working for you in digital marketing right now?\nr/DigitalMarketing\n\u2022\n8 days ago\nWhat\u2019s ACTUALLY working for you in digital marketing right now?\n73 upvotes \u00b7 72 comments\nWhat\u2019s working in digital marketing right now?\nr/DigitalMarketing\n\u2022\n5 mo. ago\nWhat\u2019s working in digital marketing right now?\n122 upvotes \u00b7 65 comments\nOverpromising in digital marketing is getting out of hand\nr/DigitalMarketing\n\u2022\n3 mo. ago\nOverpromising in digital marketing is getting out of hand\n40 upvotes \u00b7 22 comments\nAre there any good YouTube channels you recommend for learning digital marketing?\nr/DigitalMarketing\n\u2022\n17 days ago\nAre there any good YouTube channels you recommend for learning digital marketing?\n14 upvotes \u00b7 14 comments\nLooking for social media inspiration.

Which I am obsessed with. So please send some cash my way \ud83d\ude18\nIn a world of a zillion (or at least 10) great options for communities, it's hard to figure out which to go with.\nBefore we begin, 2 important things:\nIn this guide, I'll explain:\nI wanted to launch a community for Soapbox Project probably sometime in 2019. I hesitated and hesitated and hesitated. Finally, in March 2021, I launched it on Circle.\nMost builders and hackers these days will tell you to launch ASAP. I generally agree with that, but not for community-building.\nHere's a few things to ask:\n\ud83d\udca1 Options for choosing community platforms: Slack and Discord let you change the names of your channels, but not much else. Circle and Tribe felt the most customizable to me.\nLet's keep this section short. If you've answered all the questions above, you probably have 1-3 communities you'll choose from, and now it's the home stretch.\nSome things I'd keep in mind to make your final selection:\nAlso Tweet me if you have more things to add!\nThis question merits its own post and you can read more here, but here's a quick list on why I chose Circle:\nTo reiterate what I said at the beginning of this guide, your online platform is NOT your community. It's only a part of it, just as your community is only a part of your members' lives.\nAs community builders, managers, and stewards, we need to literally think outside the box (screen?) and ask ourselves: what else are we doing to build community beyond our online forum?\nIt's okay if your members will never meet in person. You can still have a vibrant, multidimensional online community that's all-virtual! Think of ways to bridge the digital with the physical though: can you host a Strava challenge for your members? Can you design fun experiences like a scavenger hunt that go beyond simply posting discussions and attending events? Can you do giveaways that you announce on your platform but require members to engage somewhere else?\nRemember: our members are human, and whatever community you're building is NOT their whole life. (And it shouldn't be, unless you're a cult leader or in an MLM, and there's a lot of overlap between the two.)\nIn our increasingly connected yet increasingly lonely world, as community leaders, we can help our members find belonging and joy by leveraging our online platform as one of many tools and experiences that bring people together. Yay!! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc6f\nBook me as a speaker\nSoapbox Project home\nSpeaking\nArticles\nSoapbox Project\nUnderstanding your members' primary interaction purpose\nNarrowing down a fitting tool (or more!)\nWhy I chose Circle\nThoughts on going beyond the online forum\nHow well will this platform integrate with others? Will you have to make infinite Zaps or are there supported integrations? \nWhat other tools will I need? Do I need a paywall? An event ticketing service? A way to collect contact info? \nWhat's a good time frame to launch fast while still being intentional? (Some communities have more learning curves than others \u2014 this is why I didn't end up going with Mighty Networks; it felt a little more setup-heavy.)\nFor my primary community with Soapbox Project, I've chosen Circle. I'll explain why I chose it over other communities I've managed/participated in.\nYour online community platform \u2260 your COMMUNITY. Your community exists in a lot of places and your members exist as their full selves. Not just on the internet, and definitely not just in the community you're building. Selecting your platform is important, but not as important as how you build your actual community.\nDo my members want to attend events or participate in discussions?\n\nIdeally, your community will have both events and discussions (and probably more stuff I'm not listing, like product discounts, jobs, etc.). Now that I'm 9 months into being a full-time community manager though, I'm realizing that most people lean towards one or the other. Most of our Soapbox members attend events. We have around 1 event a week, and these range from fireside chats that don't demand your participation, casual gatherings that require participation but don't demand a lot of focus, and action hours where you need to participate, focus, and meet others. \n\nA smaller percent of our Soapbox members post discussions. I almost shut down the community a month into launching, because it was pretty silent. I was the only one posting stuff, and it was \u2728crickets\u2728 apart from the occasional intro post + like. \n\nThen, in May, we launched biweekly fireside chats and everything changed. I should have listened to what members were saying all along \u2014 \"we want to take action and learn about the social impact space.\" Events are way better suited for this than discussion prompts. \n\n\ud83d\udca1 Options for community platforms: Circle now has its own in-house events feature (just launched during the time of publishing this post!) but I knew it could support embeds, so we've been doing some of our events with Mixily. I also considered Mighty Networks since other creators seemed to find some event-related success here. Given the 12390842983 event tools available, you can even do something as simple as launch on Discord and post Zoom links. \nDo we need asynchronous or synchronous communication?\n\nAsynchronous communication is more like Facebook groups, where people post stuff and others can reply whenever, wherever. Synchronous is real-time: it feels more direct message-y. \n\n\ud83d\udca1 Options for community platforms: Both are great, depending on what you want! Telegram is my favorite DM-feeling tool, and I'm part of a very active, vibrant, Newsletter Geeks group on there. (Shoutout Anne-Laure!) Discord is another one suited for highly conversational, synchronous communication. In my opinion, Slack is the closest best-of-both-worlds tool, but I'm just not a fan of a community platform that feels like work. I chose Circle because I knew we wanted asynchronous communication, and Circle's posts feel familiar if you've ever been in a Facebook group.\nWill members share long-form or short-form thoughts?\n\nIf you're launching a community that's resource-heavy like Work on Climate, or if your community is mostly a way to post announcements for events and meetups like Climate Changemakers, you're likely not expecting people to post long-form essays week after week. You're looking for thumbs ups, RSVPs, links to jobs, etc. \u2014 this is short-form communication.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Options for community platforms: Slack, Discord, and Telegram are great for short-form. Circle, Mighty Networks, Tribe, Wondr, and Discourse are best-suited for long-form communication. Also technically Facebook is too, but... I'm not promoting them.\nHow much customization do I need?\n\nThis is the answer that finally tipped the scale in favor of Circle when I first launched. I needed a platform that would feel like a dedicated, branded space for our members. I wanted different layouts for posts. \n\nIn the images below, you can see that we have our own branding, space names, and even can change how different spaces look. Plus, I can control the level of access each member has!\nScreenshot from our Soapbox Project community\nScreenshot from our Soapbox Project community\n\ud83d\udca1 Options for choosing community platforms: Slack and Discord let you change the names of your channels, but not much else. Circle and Tribe felt the most customizable to me. \nIs this community free, paid, or a combo?\n\nIf you need to paywall your community, it either needs its own membership OR should integrate easily with Memberful, Memberstack, Memberspace, Patreon, or Outseta. I bet I missed a few, but you can never catch em all. \u2b55\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Options for choosing community platforms: Some communities like Circle have built-in paywalls, but honestly these days, it's honestly not hard to set up a paywall for anything. I won't suggest something separate here because this is a whole new topic, but keep this in mind to free yourself of integration headaches/being stuck to a community platform just because it comes with its own paywall.\nHow frequently do we want people posting in the online forum? \n\nThis is one that I actually didn't consider until after I launched, so you can take this as my humble retrospective advice. Do you want your community to feel slow and thoughtful? Fast and real-time? \n\nIf it's the former, it's okay to optimize for a couple posts a week instead of daily posts. I don't have much to say for options here, but a few things to consider might be how searchable posts are, what notifications look like, and if members can customize to reduce or increase the info they're getting from your online platform.\n\nLogistically too, some platforms limit/price according to # of posts. For example, many community-managers run into issues with Slack where you can't search beyond a certain number of posts. \nHow long-term is the community I'm building?\n\nIf you're in this for the long game, you want a community that can change according to your goals. And you should probably think more deeply on these questions before launching, especially if (like in my case), your community IS the product.\n\nIf you're running a product-based community with the goal to connect your customers and provide proactive support, this question might not matter as much. \n\nFor me, it's been incredible to see the speed in which the Circle team rolls out features based on our (the customers') feedback. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 Love y'all.\nI wanted to optimize for thoughtful, long-form, asynchronous discussions\nI needed control over the customization of the community\nIt has a really supportive community so I can learn best practices\nLots of other community builders I respect (like Anne-Laure with Ness Labs) were using it and had good things to say\nI needed a paywall that wouldn't be too hard to use. I integrated Outseta pretty easily with Circle \u2014 it now has its own paywall too! I'm not planning on switching because I want to paywall other stuff in the future for our members, so I'm going to stick with Outseta for now.\nThe team \"gets it\".\nMathilde. If you're wondering wtf a Mathilde is, Mathilde Leo is Circle's community manager. Not only is she super helpful, she's also a good person who cares about my well-being, which I find pretty stunning for a platform with thousands of customers and community members. She's checked in on me when I broke my leg, and she's vouched for me to speak at a couple community conferences, which gave me the confidence to even be writing stuff like this in the first place.\nSpeaking\nArticles\nSoapbox Project\nFor my primary community with Soapbox Project, I've chosen Circle. I'll explain why I chose it over other communities I've managed/participated in.\nYour online community platform \u2260 your COMMUNITY. Your community exists in a lot of places and your members exist as their full selves. Not just on the internet, and definitely not just in the community you're building. Selecting your platform is important, but not as important as how you build your actual community.\nUnderstanding your members' primary interaction purpose\nNarrowing down a fitting tool (or more!)\nWhy I chose Circle\nThoughts on going beyond the online forum\nDo my members want to attend events or participate in discussions?\n\nIdeally, your community will have both events and discussions (and probably more stuff I'm not listing, like product discounts, jobs, etc.). Now that I'm 9 months into being a full-time community manager though, I'm realizing that most people lean towards one or the other. Most of our Soapbox members attend events. We have around 1 event a week, and these range from fireside chats that don't demand your participation, casual gatherings that require participation but don't demand a lot of focus, and action hours where you need to participate, focus, and meet others. \n\nA smaller percent of our Soapbox members post discussions. I almost shut down the community a month into launching, because it was pretty silent. I was the only one posting stuff, and it was \u2728crickets\u2728 apart from the occasional intro post + like. \n\nThen, in May, we launched biweekly fireside chats and everything changed. I should have listened to what members were saying all along \u2014 \"we want to take action and learn about the social impact space.\" Events are way better suited for this than discussion prompts. \n\n\ud83d\udca1 Options for community platforms: Circle now has its own in-house events feature (just launched during the time of publishing this post!) but I knew it could support embeds, so we've been doing some of our events with Mixily. I also considered Mighty Networks since other creators seemed to find some event-related success here. Given the 12390842983 event tools available, you can even do something as simple as launch on Discord and post Zoom links.\nDo we need asynchronous or synchronous communication?\n\nAsynchronous communication is more like Facebook groups, where people post stuff and others can reply whenever, wherever.

Will you have to make infinite Zaps or are there supported integrations?\nWhat other tools will I need? Do I need a paywall? An event ticketing service? A way to collect contact info?\nWhat's a good time frame to launch fast while still being intentional?

The global enterprise social networks and online communities market is expected to go beyond $5,5 million with a CAGR of 16.5% over the forecast period of 2021-2028.\nSo, whether you are running an online course, a membership site, or a business looking to connect with your audience, choosing the right community platform is paramount.\nIn this article, we will explore what online community platforms are, delve into the various key types available, guide you on how to choose the best one for your needs, and finally, present a curated list of the top 17 community platforms in the market.\nTake a moment to explore our latest enhancements to community features now available on LearnWorlds! Experience our top-rated solution for creating vibrant communities, membership sites, and comprehensive online courses all within one platform: LearnWorlds.\nSign up now for a 30-day free trial!\nSo, let\u2019s dive in!\nOnline community platforms are digital spaces where individuals with common interests or goals can connect, communicate, and collaborate. These platforms facilitate discussions, resource sharing, and the creation of a supportive environment.\nBusinesses, educational institutions, and various organizations use online community platforms to build and nurture relationships with their audiences as well as deliver educational or training content to them.\nOnline community platforms come in various types, each catering to different needs and preferences. Here are the key types of online community platforms:\nTraditional discussion forums have been a staple of online communities for decades. These offer users a structured environment where they can initiate discussions, post questions, and engage in conversations through threads.\nKnown for their longevity and straightforward design, forums are ideal for fostering ongoing discussions, Q&A sessions, and topic-based conversations.\nLeveraging the widespread use of social media platforms, social media communities bring people together within groups or dedicated pages. This type of community thrives on the familiarity and accessibility of popular social networks.\nFacebook Groups, for instance, allow users to create and join groups centered around specific interests, fostering broad audience reach, casual interactions, and seamless content sharing.\nIntegrated within educational platforms, LMS communities enhance the learning experience by facilitating interaction among students and instructors.\nLearnWorlds, for example, is a comprehensive learning management system (LMS) that seamlessly integrates community features, creating an environment where learners can discuss course materials, ask questions, and collaborate on projects.\nMembership site communities are tied to exclusive content and benefits, fostering a sense of exclusivity among paying members.\nThese communities are effective in cultivating engagement and loyalty among members, providing a space for exclusive discussions, member-only resources, and personalized experiences.\nSome blogs incorporate community elements such as comments, forums, or user-generated content, expanding the traditional blog format.\nWordPress, when paired with other plugins, transforms a blog into a social network with community features. Similarly, popular content-sharing platforms like Medium, allow users to engage in discussions through comments, emphasizing the collaborative nature of content creation within a community context.\nCollaboration platforms are designed for team communication, document sharing, and project management. This type of community platforms which include Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Asana, not only facilitate collaboration but also incorporate communication features like channels and threads.\nIdeal for businesses and remote teams, collaboration platforms create a centralized space for discussions, file sharing, and real-time project updates.\nQuestion and answer platforms are tailored for knowledge-sharing, troubleshooting, and expertise recognition. Platforms like Quora provide a space for users to pose questions, receive answers, and contribute to a community-driven knowledge base.\nSuch platforms often incorporate features like voting to highlight the best answers and surface the most valuable information.\nEvent communities are centered around organizing and participating in events, both online and offline. Platforms like Eventbrite and Meetup enable users to engage in pre-event and post-event discussions, fostering networking opportunities and extending the overall event experience.\nLinkedIn Events also provides a professional space for event-related discussions, allowing participants to connect and share insights.\nCustomer support communities play a crucial role in enhancing customer satisfaction and support. Notable platforms in this category are Zendesk Community and Salesforce Community Cloud which provide dedicated spaces for users to seek help, share solutions, and provide feedback.\nThese communities not only empower users to find answers independently but also create a collaborative environment where customers can connect with each other.\nNiche communities cater to specific industries, hobbies, or interests, creating a sense of belonging among like-minded individuals. This includes platforms like Reddit for example, with its extensive array of subreddits covering diverse topics, DeviantArt for artists, and Goodreads for book enthusiasts, providing targeted spaces for discussions, networking, and shared experiences.\nNiche communities thrive on the depth of their discussions and the shared passion of their members.\nIn the dynamic realm of online community building, the choice of platform can make all the difference in creating a thriving digital ecosystem. As the demand for virtual connections continues to surge, navigating the myriad of options becomes a crucial task.\n\ud83d\udc49 Here are our top 4 choices out of all the platforms mentioned in the article compared based on pricing and key features:\nBelow we present a curated list of the top 17 online community platforms that stand as pioneers in facilitating meaningful interactions.\nWhether you\u2019re aiming to enhance education, foster collaboration, or build a loyal membership base, these platforms have been chosen for their exceptional features, user-friendly interfaces, and the ability to transform digital spaces into vibrant hubs of engagement.\nLearnWorlds is our very own platform and the top choice when it comes to building a vibrant online community of learners.

Consider features such as discussion threads, file sharing, event management, and any other functionality crucial to your community\u2019s interactions.\nFor instance, if your community thrives on discussions and collaboration, prioritize platforms with robust discussion thread capabilities.

Anticipate future needs and select a platform that can accommodate an increasing number of members and a growing volume of content. Ensure that the platform\u2019s infrastructure can handle increased activity without compromising performance.\nCheck its Integration Capabilities:\nIntegration capabilities are essential, especially if your community will be part of a broader ecosystem.\nCheck whether the platform integrates seamlessly with other tools and platforms you use, such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems or marketing software. This integration ensures a cohesive experience for both community members and administrators.\nPrioritize User Experience:\nThe success of your community depends on the engagement of its members, making user experience a critical factor. Prioritize platforms with an intuitive interface and user-friendly features to enhance engagement. Ensure that navigation is straightforward, and features are easily accessible to both new and experienced users.\nKeep in mind that the platform you select should not only meet your current needs but also provide flexibility for future growth and evolution. Whether your community is focused on support, networking, learning, or a combination of these, a well-chosen platform will contribute significantly to its success.\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of online education, the importance of community engagement cannot be overstated.

You can monetize your community, too, with subscriptions, digital products, exclusive content, and more.\nHere are the best online community platforms in 2025\u2014perfect for engaging your customers, monetizing your following, and leveling up your business.\nSkip ahead:\nWhat are online community platforms?\nHow to choose the best online community platform for you\nTop 16 best online community platforms in 2025\nReady to launch your online community with confidence?\nAn online community platform is specialized software that acts as a virtual space for people with shared interests to meet, connect, and interact.\nFor example, Reddit is the largest platform for online communities worldwide and one of the most visited websites worldwide. More than 100,000 active subreddits (aka communities) are on the platform, which see millions of daily users and visitors.\nReddit unites users around their common interests. Any user can start a new subreddit community, and users can be part of more than one community simultaneously.\nOnline community platforms can include:\nFor businesses, online community platforms also offer the chance to connect to their target audience and create an exclusive online space for sharing product-related discussions, exclusive offers, and more.\nRelated: It\u2019s Time to Tap Into Togetherness with Communities\nOnline community platforms can be separated into 2 broad categories: public social networks and private community platforms.\nPublic social networks include top social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, as well as discussion-based websites like Reddit. They\u2019re typically free to use and have millions of active users.\nPrivate community platforms include membership sites and creator platforms like Thinkific and Kajabi. They are generally subscription-based platforms where businesses can create private community spaces for their customers while also selling other digital products.\nBoth types of online community platforms have their advantages and disadvantages.\nPublic social networks can help you to:\nHowever, the downside of public social networks is that you typically have less control over your community. For example, if Facebook decides to shut down your group, you can do nothing about it. This can be stressful if you\u2019re trying to build a business.\nFor brands, private community platforms come with a range of benefits, including:\nThere is a wide range of online community platforms on the market, but how do you know which one is right for your business?\nIf choosing an online community platform feels daunting, here are 6 steps to help:\nReady to find the platform for you?

From an admin perspective, the course builder is intuitive, the admin functions are straightforward to navigate, and launching new courses is a simple process. The recent enhancements to the Analytics experience have been particularly beneficial.\u201d \u2013 Chelsea M.\nBilled as an all-in-one community for creators and brands, this platform\u2019s minimalist approach doesn\u2019t detract from its powerful features. Circle makes creating your own branded community easy with its custom domain name.\nEngage your online community with live Q&As, weekly office hours, direct messaging, group coaching, and exclusive masterclasses. There\u2019s also a mobile app to make sure your community can stay connected on the go. And when monetizing your business, Circle offers you a range of options \u2013 including memberships, recurring subscriptions, and one-time access payments.\nCircle\u2019s key features:\nCircle\u2019s G2 Score: 4.8/5\nCircle\u2019s pricing:\n\u201cI really liked how simple and clean the platform feels. It\u2019s super easy to navigate, so I didn\u2019t have to waste time figuring out how things work. Plus, being able to organize different groups in one place is a game-changer. It feels professional but still personal, which is perfect for building a real community.\u201d \u2013 Joshua M.\nThis community platform, formerly known as Mighty Networks, makes it easy to invite your community members to discuss anything you have to offer, from online courses to ebooks. Users can post messages and chat with each other on the platform, helping to build closer bonds in your community.\nNew posts are easy to create with an intuitive CMS and can include images, videos, audio, surveys and more. Users also have the option to engage with your content via a community app.\nMighty\u2019s key features:\nMighty\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nMighty\u2019s pricing:\n\u201cOne of the standout features of Mighty Networks is its robust community-building capabilities. The platform allows users to create engaging online communities with tools for rich media posts, events, and online courses, all tailored to foster interaction among members.\u201d \u2013 Jayson B.\nRelated: Thinkific vs Mighty Networks \u2013 A detailed comparison\nMost of your community \u2013 regardless of demographics \u2013 probably have a Facebook profile already. This makes Facebook Groups an easy choice when considering a new online community platform. Users can simply log in to their Facebook and join your group \u2013 it\u2019s that simple.\nFacebook Groups are completely free to use \u2013 but the downside is that most members won\u2019t see your posts in their activity feed, so they\u2019ll need to visit the group directly to engage with your content. That means member engagement in Facebook Groups is generally low \u2013 and monetizing your community using Facebook alone is hard.\nIn recent years, Facebook has also faced many challenges ranging from usability, data privacy issues, and ownership. So while it can be really useful to get your community started, it\u2019s best to use it with another online community platform that gives you more control and security.\nFacebook\u2019s key features:\nFacebook\u2019s G2 rating: 4.3/5\nFacebook pricing:\nFacebook groups are free for all account holders to use. This combined with its exceptional ubiquity makes it one of the best free online community platforms on the market.\nRelated: The best Facebook Group Alternatives\nSlack isn\u2019t just a work chat \u2013 it\u2019s also an easy way to organize a community online. The free plan allows you to add unlimited community members to the platform but caps visible messages to 10,000 (they can be viewed by subscribing to a paid plan). Paid plans allow for more storage, app integrations and group calls.\nOn Slack, direct messages are the name of the game and you can create channels to keep various topics neatly organized. Recently, Slack has added audio and video call features too.\nSlack is a great choice for anyone looking to keep the conversation going, but there are limited options to customize the platform to your brand.\nSlack\u2019s key features:\nSlack\u2019s G2 score: 4.5/5\nSlack\u2019s pricing:\nTo enjoy the features of a paid Slack plan, everyone in your community must pay for the same plan. You (the admin) can\u2019t just pay $7 for a few features. You must pay $7 for every member, all at once. Because of this, paid plans are almost never used beyond a corporate setting.\nHowever, Slack\u2019s free plan allows you to create a group and invite anyone to the community. You can enjoy basic features, putting this platform close behind Facebook in its running as one of the best free online community platforms.\n\u201cWhat I like best about Slack is how it simplifies team communication with its intuitive interface, organized channels, and seamless integrations with tools like Google Drive and Trello. It keeps conversations focused, reduces email clutter, and makes real-time collaboration effortless\u2026\u201d \u2013 Monica L.\nAnyone in the gaming community has heard of Discord \u2013 an instant messaging platform with support for voice calls, video calls, and chats.\nDiscord is free to use \u2013 users can choose whether to upgrade their account to a pro user, unlocking extra features. Like Slack, Discord is a good option for creating an online community based on instant and spontaneous chatting. The same user can belong to multiple communities, so creating a new online community is easy if your target audience is already using Discord.\nDiscord\u2019s key features:\nDiscord\u2019s G2 score: Not rated\nDiscord\u2019s pricing:\nLike Facebook and Slack, Discord is another one of the best free online community platforms. Free for everyone. All you need to do is download it to get started.\nHowever, users can upgrade to Nitro Basic or Nitro for additional benefits that enhance the user experience.\nSimilar to online course marketplaces like Skillshare or Udemy, Skool is a central hub for a vast catalog of online communities. Learners can find all kinds of communities ranging from financial literacy to influencer 101. Creators, on the other hand, can leverage all of the classic features one would expect from a community or course builder today.\nAs one of the best online community platforms in 2025, Skool makes it easy to set up your group in minutes. Offer paid or free communities, embed video, images, schedule live events, and gather emails for marketing automation. Retain and engage members with engagement features like a leaderboard or even levels, where certain achievements can unlock access to resources, coaching sessions, and more.\nSkool\u2019s key features:\nSkool\u2019s pricing:\nSkool is free for the first 14 days; after your trial expires, the monthly rate is $99. This plan allows for 1 group and grants access to all features, unlimited courses, and unlimited members.\nBettermode is one of the best platforms for online community because, for many creators, it\u2019s all they\u2019ll need to start and scale their communities. The platform contains valuable features, including member profiles, member roles, multiple log-in authentication routes, a flexible and customizable community structure, and so much more.\nUse the platform\u2019s pre-built templates to expedite your launch. Or, customize the start-up using Bettermode\u2019s array of customization tools, drag-and-drop builder, integrations/app library, or developer portal.\nBettermode\u2019s key features:\nBettermode\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nBettermode\u2019s pricing:\nIn the platform\u2019s own words, the free plan is \u201cIdeal for hobbyists and individuals exploring web app creation.\u201d\nWith a cap of 10 members and 5 spaces, the free plan is effectively an untimed free trial. However, in an era where true free plans are disappearing, it\u2019s nice to see one that isn\u2019t limited to a small time frame.\nThe rest of Bettermode\u2019s pricing plans are as follows:\n\u201cMaking a cookie free, non-tracked community that looks better than the current iteration of mega-platforms without losing the community building features that matter. Profiles and member-to-member messaging make engagement between members easy.\nLots of features work well for product development and networks. The platform is a great option for a multi-passionate influencer or brand with multiple divisions and different audiences.\u201d \u2013 Shawneda C.\nKajabi is a well-rounded online community platform to help you grow your business with creative custom solutions. Take advantage of the built-in CRM, collect payments with Stripe and Paypal integrations, and use analytics to make data-driven decisions about your business.\nKajabi provides the tools you need to create content and show the world what you do best.

Setting up was super easy, and it has a ton of solutions to let you manage everything in your work in one place. The builder is quite easy, and the campaign builder is especially powerful.\u201d \u2013 Gabriel C.\nRelated:\nVanilla Forums is an online community platform that lets companies connect with their customers. This forum software is easy to customize; however, you must use HTML and CSS. Users can mention each other, leave comments, ask questions, send private messages, create polls, and more.\nAs a business, you can run multiple sub-communities on Vanilla Forums and assign community admins for moderation. Each forum can be customized for a specific goal, whether as a knowledge base, a space for Q&As, or anything in between.\nVanilla\u2019s key features:\nVanilla\u2019s G2 score: 4.3/5\nVanilla\u2019s pricing:\nThis platform\u2019s pricing is not available online. Unfortunately, you must set up a demo call with a sales rep to receive pricing info.\n\u201cVanilla offers a wide range of out-of-the-box configuration options that can be easily set up by non-technical users. It also integrates seamlessly with various popular CRM applications. The Customer Support team is excellent and responds quickly to inquiries.\u201d \u2013 Vidya S.\nSpark conversations around your work with Podia. This all-in-one community building tool lets you build free and paid communities, with all the features you need to navigate through the process of creating and managing an online community. They make the whole process clear, easy and straightforward\u2014including giving you the chance to create a website, webinars, coaching packages, and optional email marketing add-ons to promote your content.\nPodia\u2019s key features:\nPodia\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nPodia\u2019s pricing:\n\u201cUsing podia for years so couldn\u2019t recommend it more. It\u2019s especially great for people like me who want a tool that is both simple for the end-user and the content creator. Many tools out there just have such a bad UX for the end-user, and this one makes a lot of things right.\u201d  \u2013 Daniele C.\nRelated: Podia vs Thinkific \u2013 A detailed comparison\nDesigned for individual creators and established businesses alike, Disciple lets you manage your content and your community from your mobile or desktop.

Kick start community conversations with groups, polls, and comments, and connect with your members in real time via live streams and direct messaging options.\nDisciple\u2019s key features:\nDesciple\u2019s G2 score: 4.7/5\nDesciple\u2019s pricing:\nDisciple offers three pricing plans. The below amounts reflect your monthly breakdown, but note that the platform only offers billing in 6-month or 12-month terms.\n\u201cDisciple is built to counter all the things people hate about FB groups, forum sites, and traditional social media feeds. Giving control back to the community (and away from advertisers and spammers) makes for a better experience. The UX is simple, and the support team is fantastic.\u201d \u2013 Brandon B.\nWhen it comes to open-source community platforms, Discourse is taking the lead. The top benefit of this community platform is that you can tweak the codebase however you need to build the community features you want.\nAt the same time, Discourse is a pretty powerful platform right out of the box. Bring together your community and organize it into separate categories and threads, assign moderators, and more. Users can post, message each other, and share content, all within the platform.\nAnother helpful power feature Discourse offers is automatic filtering for spammers and trolls to make community moderation easy \u2013 so you can have more peace of mind.\nDiscourse\u2019s key features:\nDiscourse\u2019s G2 score: 4.0/5\nDiscourse\u2019s pricing:\n\u201cWe chose Discourse about five years ago because we wanted to create a place for an in-depth conversation about new research that was coming out in occupational therapy. And it has delivered! I am consistently amazed by the quality of conversation that the platform fosters.\u201d \u2013 Sarah L.\nBuild a custom membership platform with MemberDev and grow your online community from the ground up.

What are your KPIs?\nLook at key features: Write a list of the must-have features you need from your community platforms, like live-streaming, 1:1 chat functions, and more.\nBe realistic about size: The size of your community will greatly impact the type of community platform that\u2019s best for you \u2013 including pricing and limits. Create an estimate for your community size before choosing a platform.\nPrioritize scalable solutions: Your business is likely to grow \u2013 so any community platform must also be scalable to match your changing needs.\nCheck your budget: Budget also has a role to play in choosing the right community platform.

Users can post messages and chat with each other on the platform, helping to build closer bonds in your community.\nNew posts are easy to create with an intuitive CMS and can include images, videos, audio, surveys and more. Users also have the option to engage with your content via a community app.\nMighty\u2019s key features:\nDirect messages between members\nCreate multimedia posts\nAdd unlimited admins and members\nMighty\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nMighty\u2019s pricing:\nThe Community Plan ($49/month)\nThe Courses Plan ($119/month)\nThe Business Plan ($219/month)\nThe Path-to-Pro Plan ($430/month)\nMighty Pro (custom pricing)\n\u201cOne of the standout features of Mighty Networks is its robust community-building capabilities. The platform allows users to create engaging online communities with tools for rich media posts, events, and online courses, all tailored to foster interaction among members.\u201d \u2013 Jayson B.\nRelated: Thinkific vs Mighty Networks \u2013 A detailed comparison\nFacebook Groups\nMost of your community \u2013 regardless of demographics \u2013 probably have a Facebook profile already. This makes Facebook Groups an easy choice when considering a new online community platform. Users can simply log in to their Facebook and join your group \u2013 it\u2019s that simple.\nFacebook Groups are completely free to use \u2013 but the downside is that most members won\u2019t see your posts in their activity feed, so they\u2019ll need to visit the group directly to engage with your content. That means member engagement in Facebook Groups is generally low \u2013 and monetizing your community using Facebook alone is hard.\nIn recent years, Facebook has also faced many challenges ranging from usability, data privacy issues, and ownership. So while it can be really useful to get your community started, it\u2019s best to use it with another online community platform that gives you more control and security.\nFacebook\u2019s key features:\nSeamless integration with the Facebook ecosystem (Messenger, Meta, etc.)\nTrack growth and engagement with an insights dashboard\nExceptional international accessibility\nFacebook\u2019s G2 rating: 4.3/5\nFacebook pricing:\nFacebook groups are free for all account holders to use. This combined with its exceptional ubiquity makes it one of the best free online community platforms on the market.\nRelated: The best Facebook Group Alternatives\nSlack\nSlack isn\u2019t just a work chat \u2013 it\u2019s also an easy way to organize a community online. The free plan allows you to add unlimited community members to the platform but caps visible messages to 10,000 (they can be viewed by subscribing to a paid plan). Paid plans allow for more storage, app integrations and group calls.\nOn Slack, direct messages are the name of the game and you can create channels to keep various topics neatly organized. Recently, Slack has added audio and video call features too.\nSlack is a great choice for anyone looking to keep the conversation going, but there are limited options to customize the platform to your brand.\nSlack\u2019s key features:\nUnlimited members\nDirect messaging\nWidely used\nSlack\u2019s G2 score: 4.5/5\nSlack\u2019s pricing:\nTo enjoy the features of a paid Slack plan, everyone in your community must pay for the same plan. You (the admin) can\u2019t just pay $7 for a few features. You must pay $7 for every member, all at once. Because of this, paid plans are almost never used beyond a corporate setting.\nHowever, Slack\u2019s free plan allows you to create a group and invite anyone to the community. You can enjoy basic features, putting this platform close behind Facebook in its running as one of the best free online community platforms.\n\u201cWhat I like best about Slack is how it simplifies team communication with its intuitive interface, organized channels, and seamless integrations with tools like Google Drive and Trello. It keeps conversations focused, reduces email clutter, and makes real-time collaboration effortless\u2026\u201d \u2013 Monica L.\nDiscord\nAnyone in the gaming community has heard of Discord \u2013 an instant messaging platform with support for voice calls, video calls, and chats.\nDiscord is free to use \u2013 users can choose whether to upgrade their account to a pro user, unlocking extra features. Like Slack, Discord is a good option for creating an online community based on instant and spontaneous chatting. The same user can belong to multiple communities, so creating a new online community is easy if your target audience is already using Discord.\nDiscord\u2019s key features:\nFree to use\nSimple chat-focused interface\nSet up separate channels\nDiscord\u2019s G2 score: Not rated\nDiscord\u2019s pricing: \nLike Facebook and Slack, Discord is another one of the best free online community platforms. Free for everyone. All you need to do is download it to get started.\nHowever, users can upgrade to Nitro Basic or Nitro for additional benefits that enhance the user experience.\nSkool\nSimilar to online course marketplaces like Skillshare or Udemy, Skool is a central hub for a vast catalog of online communities. Learners can find all kinds of communities ranging from financial literacy to influencer 101. Creators, on the other hand, can leverage all of the classic features one would expect from a community or course builder today.\nAs one of the best online community platforms in 2025, Skool makes it easy to set up your group in minutes. Offer paid or free communities, embed video, images, schedule live events, and gather emails for marketing automation. Retain and engage members with engagement features like a leaderboard or even levels, where certain achievements can unlock access to resources, coaching sessions, and more.\nSkool\u2019s key features:\nIntuitive community and course creation interface\nSkool gamification encourages community engagement\nSimple 1-plan pricing\nSkool\u2019s pricing:\nSkool is free for the first 14 days; after your trial expires, the monthly rate is $99. This plan allows for 1 group and grants access to all features, unlimited courses, and unlimited members.\nBettermode\nBettermode is one of the best platforms for online community because, for many creators, it\u2019s all they\u2019ll need to start and scale their communities. The platform contains valuable features, including member profiles, member roles, multiple log-in authentication routes, a flexible and customizable community structure, and so much more.\nUse the platform\u2019s pre-built templates to expedite your launch. Or, customize the start-up using Bettermode\u2019s array of customization tools, drag-and-drop builder, integrations/app library, or developer portal.\nBettermode\u2019s key features:\nDrag-and-drop builder makes creation a breeze, with the option to customize further using code\nA community analytics dashboard gives you insight into metrics like member growth, activity, unique daily visits, and more\nLeverage social login for near frictionless accessibility\nBettermode\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nBettermode\u2019s pricing:\nIn the platform\u2019s own words, the free plan is \u201cIdeal for hobbyists and individuals exploring web app creation.\u201d\nWith a cap of 10 members and 5 spaces, the free plan is effectively an untimed free trial. However, in an era where true free plans are disappearing, it\u2019s nice to see one that isn\u2019t limited to a small time frame.\nThe rest of Bettermode\u2019s pricing plans are as follows:\nFree ($0/month)\nLite ($24/month)\nPro ($59/month)\nBusiness ($119/month)\n\u201cMaking a cookie free, non-tracked community that looks better than the current iteration of mega-platforms without losing the community building features that matter. Profiles and member-to-member messaging make engagement between members easy.\nLots of features work well for product development and networks. The platform is a great option for a multi-passionate influencer or brand with multiple divisions and different audiences.\u201d \u2013 Shawneda C.\nKajabi\nKajabi is a well-rounded online community platform to help you grow your business with creative custom solutions.

Users can post messages and chat with each other on the platform, helping to build closer bonds in your community.\nNew posts are easy to create with an intuitive CMS and can include images, videos, audio, surveys and more. Users also have the option to engage with your content via a community app.\nMighty\u2019s key features:\nDirect messages between members\nCreate multimedia posts\nAdd unlimited admins and members\nMighty\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nMighty\u2019s pricing:\nThe Community Plan ($49/month)\nThe Courses Plan ($119/month)\nThe Business Plan ($219/month)\nThe Path-to-Pro Plan ($430/month)\nMighty Pro (custom pricing)\n\u201cOne of the standout features of Mighty Networks is its robust community-building capabilities. The platform allows users to create engaging online communities with tools for rich media posts, events, and online courses, all tailored to foster interaction among members.\u201d \u2013 Jayson B.\nRelated: Thinkific vs Mighty Networks \u2013 A detailed comparison\nFacebook Groups\nMost of your community \u2013 regardless of demographics \u2013 probably have a Facebook profile already. This makes Facebook Groups an easy choice when considering a new online community platform. Users can simply log in to their Facebook and join your group \u2013 it\u2019s that simple.\nFacebook Groups are completely free to use \u2013 but the downside is that most members won\u2019t see your posts in their activity feed, so they\u2019ll need to visit the group directly to engage with your content. That means member engagement in Facebook Groups is generally low \u2013 and monetizing your community using Facebook alone is hard.\nIn recent years, Facebook has also faced many challenges ranging from usability, data privacy issues, and ownership. So while it can be really useful to get your community started, it\u2019s best to use it with another online community platform that gives you more control and security.\nFacebook\u2019s key features:\nSeamless integration with the Facebook ecosystem (Messenger, Meta, etc.)\nTrack growth and engagement with an insights dashboard\nExceptional international accessibility\nFacebook\u2019s G2 rating: 4.3/5\nFacebook pricing:\nFacebook groups are free for all account holders to use. This combined with its exceptional ubiquity makes it one of the best free online community platforms on the market.\nRelated: The best Facebook Group Alternatives\nSlack\nSlack isn\u2019t just a work chat \u2013 it\u2019s also an easy way to organize a community online. The free plan allows you to add unlimited community members to the platform but caps visible messages to 10,000 (they can be viewed by subscribing to a paid plan). Paid plans allow for more storage, app integrations and group calls.\nOn Slack, direct messages are the name of the game and you can create channels to keep various topics neatly organized. Recently, Slack has added audio and video call features too.\nSlack is a great choice for anyone looking to keep the conversation going, but there are limited options to customize the platform to your brand.\nSlack\u2019s key features:\nUnlimited members\nDirect messaging\nWidely used\nSlack\u2019s G2 score: 4.5/5\nSlack\u2019s pricing:\nTo enjoy the features of a paid Slack plan, everyone in your community must pay for the same plan. You (the admin) can\u2019t just pay $7 for a few features. You must pay $7 for every member, all at once. Because of this, paid plans are almost never used beyond a corporate setting.\nHowever, Slack\u2019s free plan allows you to create a group and invite anyone to the community. You can enjoy basic features, putting this platform close behind Facebook in its running as one of the best free online community platforms.\n\u201cWhat I like best about Slack is how it simplifies team communication with its intuitive interface, organized channels, and seamless integrations with tools like Google Drive and Trello. It keeps conversations focused, reduces email clutter, and makes real-time collaboration effortless\u2026\u201d \u2013 Monica L.\nDiscord\nAnyone in the gaming community has heard of Discord \u2013 an instant messaging platform with support for voice calls, video calls, and chats.\nDiscord is free to use \u2013 users can choose whether to upgrade their account to a pro user, unlocking extra features. Like Slack, Discord is a good option for creating an online community based on instant and spontaneous chatting. The same user can belong to multiple communities, so creating a new online community is easy if your target audience is already using Discord.\nDiscord\u2019s key features:\nFree to use\nSimple chat-focused interface\nSet up separate channels\nDiscord\u2019s G2 score: Not rated\nDiscord\u2019s pricing: \nLike Facebook and Slack, Discord is another one of the best free online community platforms. Free for everyone. All you need to do is download it to get started.\nHowever, users can upgrade to Nitro Basic or Nitro for additional benefits that enhance the user experience.\nSkool\nSimilar to online course marketplaces like Skillshare or Udemy, Skool is a central hub for a vast catalog of online communities. Learners can find all kinds of communities ranging from financial literacy to influencer 101. Creators, on the other hand, can leverage all of the classic features one would expect from a community or course builder today.\nAs one of the best online community platforms in 2025, Skool makes it easy to set up your group in minutes. Offer paid or free communities, embed video, images, schedule live events, and gather emails for marketing automation. Retain and engage members with engagement features like a leaderboard or even levels, where certain achievements can unlock access to resources, coaching sessions, and more.\nSkool\u2019s key features:\nIntuitive community and course creation interface\nSkool gamification encourages community engagement\nSimple 1-plan pricing\nSkool\u2019s pricing:\nSkool is free for the first 14 days; after your trial expires, the monthly rate is $99. This plan allows for 1 group and grants access to all features, unlimited courses, and unlimited members.\nBettermode\nBettermode is one of the best platforms for online community because, for many creators, it\u2019s all they\u2019ll need to start and scale their communities. The platform contains valuable features, including member profiles, member roles, multiple log-in authentication routes, a flexible and customizable community structure, and so much more.\nUse the platform\u2019s pre-built templates to expedite your launch. Or, customize the start-up using Bettermode\u2019s array of customization tools, drag-and-drop builder, integrations/app library, or developer portal.\nBettermode\u2019s key features:\nDrag-and-drop builder makes creation a breeze, with the option to customize further using code\nA community analytics dashboard gives you insight into metrics like member growth, activity, unique daily visits, and more\nLeverage social login for near frictionless accessibility\nBettermode\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nBettermode\u2019s pricing:\nIn the platform\u2019s own words, the free plan is \u201cIdeal for hobbyists and individuals exploring web app creation.\u201d\nWith a cap of 10 members and 5 spaces, the free plan is effectively an untimed free trial. However, in an era where true free plans are disappearing, it\u2019s nice to see one that isn\u2019t limited to a small time frame.\nThe rest of Bettermode\u2019s pricing plans are as follows:\nFree ($0/month)\nLite ($24/month)\nPro ($59/month)\nBusiness ($119/month)\n\u201cMaking a cookie free, non-tracked community that looks better than the current iteration of mega-platforms without losing the community building features that matter. Profiles and member-to-member messaging make engagement between members easy.\nLots of features work well for product development and networks. The platform is a great option for a multi-passionate influencer or brand with multiple divisions and different audiences.\u201d \u2013 Shawneda C.\nKajabi\nKajabi is a well-rounded online community platform to help you grow your business with creative custom solutions.

Users can post messages and chat with each other on the platform, helping to build closer bonds in your community.\nNew posts are easy to create with an intuitive CMS and can include images, videos, audio, surveys and more. Users also have the option to engage with your content via a community app.\nMighty\u2019s key features:\nDirect messages between members\nCreate multimedia posts\nAdd unlimited admins and members\nMighty\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nMighty\u2019s pricing:\nThe Community Plan ($49/month)\nThe Courses Plan ($119/month)\nThe Business Plan ($219/month)\nThe Path-to-Pro Plan ($430/month)\nMighty Pro (custom pricing)\n\u201cOne of the standout features of Mighty Networks is its robust community-building capabilities. The platform allows users to create engaging online communities with tools for rich media posts, events, and online courses, all tailored to foster interaction among members.\u201d \u2013 Jayson B.\nRelated: Thinkific vs Mighty Networks \u2013 A detailed comparison\nFacebook Groups\nMost of your community \u2013 regardless of demographics \u2013 probably have a Facebook profile already. This makes Facebook Groups an easy choice when considering a new online community platform. Users can simply log in to their Facebook and join your group \u2013 it\u2019s that simple.\nFacebook Groups are completely free to use \u2013 but the downside is that most members won\u2019t see your posts in their activity feed, so they\u2019ll need to visit the group directly to engage with your content. That means member engagement in Facebook Groups is generally low \u2013 and monetizing your community using Facebook alone is hard.\nIn recent years, Facebook has also faced many challenges ranging from usability, data privacy issues, and ownership. So while it can be really useful to get your community started, it\u2019s best to use it with another online community platform that gives you more control and security.\nFacebook\u2019s key features:\nSeamless integration with the Facebook ecosystem (Messenger, Meta, etc.)\nTrack growth and engagement with an insights dashboard\nExceptional international accessibility\nFacebook\u2019s G2 rating: 4.3/5\nFacebook pricing:\nFacebook groups are free for all account holders to use. This combined with its exceptional ubiquity makes it one of the best free online community platforms on the market.\nRelated: The best Facebook Group Alternatives\nSlack\nSlack isn\u2019t just a work chat \u2013 it\u2019s also an easy way to organize a community online. The free plan allows you to add unlimited community members to the platform but caps visible messages to 10,000 (they can be viewed by subscribing to a paid plan). Paid plans allow for more storage, app integrations and group calls.\nOn Slack, direct messages are the name of the game and you can create channels to keep various topics neatly organized. Recently, Slack has added audio and video call features too.\nSlack is a great choice for anyone looking to keep the conversation going, but there are limited options to customize the platform to your brand.\nSlack\u2019s key features:\nUnlimited members\nDirect messaging\nWidely used\nSlack\u2019s G2 score: 4.5/5\nSlack\u2019s pricing:\nTo enjoy the features of a paid Slack plan, everyone in your community must pay for the same plan. You (the admin) can\u2019t just pay $7 for a few features. You must pay $7 for every member, all at once. Because of this, paid plans are almost never used beyond a corporate setting.\nHowever, Slack\u2019s free plan allows you to create a group and invite anyone to the community. You can enjoy basic features, putting this platform close behind Facebook in its running as one of the best free online community platforms.\n\u201cWhat I like best about Slack is how it simplifies team communication with its intuitive interface, organized channels, and seamless integrations with tools like Google Drive and Trello. It keeps conversations focused, reduces email clutter, and makes real-time collaboration effortless\u2026\u201d \u2013 Monica L.\nDiscord\nAnyone in the gaming community has heard of Discord \u2013 an instant messaging platform with support for voice calls, video calls, and chats.\nDiscord is free to use \u2013 users can choose whether to upgrade their account to a pro user, unlocking extra features. Like Slack, Discord is a good option for creating an online community based on instant and spontaneous chatting. The same user can belong to multiple communities, so creating a new online community is easy if your target audience is already using Discord.\nDiscord\u2019s key features:\nFree to use\nSimple chat-focused interface\nSet up separate channels\nDiscord\u2019s G2 score: Not rated\nDiscord\u2019s pricing: \nLike Facebook and Slack, Discord is another one of the best free online community platforms. Free for everyone. All you need to do is download it to get started.\nHowever, users can upgrade to Nitro Basic or Nitro for additional benefits that enhance the user experience.\nSkool\nSimilar to online course marketplaces like Skillshare or Udemy, Skool is a central hub for a vast catalog of online communities. Learners can find all kinds of communities ranging from financial literacy to influencer 101. Creators, on the other hand, can leverage all of the classic features one would expect from a community or course builder today.\nAs one of the best online community platforms in 2025, Skool makes it easy to set up your group in minutes. Offer paid or free communities, embed video, images, schedule live events, and gather emails for marketing automation. Retain and engage members with engagement features like a leaderboard or even levels, where certain achievements can unlock access to resources, coaching sessions, and more.\nSkool\u2019s key features:\nIntuitive community and course creation interface\nSkool gamification encourages community engagement\nSimple 1-plan pricing\nSkool\u2019s pricing:\nSkool is free for the first 14 days; after your trial expires, the monthly rate is $99. This plan allows for 1 group and grants access to all features, unlimited courses, and unlimited members.\nBettermode\nBettermode is one of the best platforms for online community because, for many creators, it\u2019s all they\u2019ll need to start and scale their communities. The platform contains valuable features, including member profiles, member roles, multiple log-in authentication routes, a flexible and customizable community structure, and so much more.\nUse the platform\u2019s pre-built templates to expedite your launch. Or, customize the start-up using Bettermode\u2019s array of customization tools, drag-and-drop builder, integrations/app library, or developer portal.\nBettermode\u2019s key features:\nDrag-and-drop builder makes creation a breeze, with the option to customize further using code\nA community analytics dashboard gives you insight into metrics like member growth, activity, unique daily visits, and more\nLeverage social login for near frictionless accessibility\nBettermode\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nBettermode\u2019s pricing:\nIn the platform\u2019s own words, the free plan is \u201cIdeal for hobbyists and individuals exploring web app creation.\u201d\nWith a cap of 10 members and 5 spaces, the free plan is effectively an untimed free trial. However, in an era where true free plans are disappearing, it\u2019s nice to see one that isn\u2019t limited to a small time frame.\nThe rest of Bettermode\u2019s pricing plans are as follows:\nFree ($0/month)\nLite ($24/month)\nPro ($59/month)\nBusiness ($119/month)\n\u201cMaking a cookie free, non-tracked community that looks better than the current iteration of mega-platforms without losing the community building features that matter. Profiles and member-to-member messaging make engagement between members easy.\nLots of features work well for product development and networks. The platform is a great option for a multi-passionate influencer or brand with multiple divisions and different audiences.\u201d \u2013 Shawneda C.\nKajabi\nKajabi is a well-rounded online community platform to help you grow your business with creative custom solutions.

Users can post messages and chat with each other on the platform, helping to build closer bonds in your community.\nNew posts are easy to create with an intuitive CMS and can include images, videos, audio, surveys and more. Users also have the option to engage with your content via a community app.\nMighty\u2019s key features:\nDirect messages between members\nCreate multimedia posts\nAdd unlimited admins and members\nMighty\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nMighty\u2019s pricing:\nThe Community Plan ($49/month)\nThe Courses Plan ($119/month)\nThe Business Plan ($219/month)\nThe Path-to-Pro Plan ($430/month)\nMighty Pro (custom pricing)\n\u201cOne of the standout features of Mighty Networks is its robust community-building capabilities. The platform allows users to create engaging online communities with tools for rich media posts, events, and online courses, all tailored to foster interaction among members.\u201d \u2013 Jayson B.\nRelated: Thinkific vs Mighty Networks \u2013 A detailed comparison\nFacebook Groups\nMost of your community \u2013 regardless of demographics \u2013 probably have a Facebook profile already. This makes Facebook Groups an easy choice when considering a new online community platform. Users can simply log in to their Facebook and join your group \u2013 it\u2019s that simple.\nFacebook Groups are completely free to use \u2013 but the downside is that most members won\u2019t see your posts in their activity feed, so they\u2019ll need to visit the group directly to engage with your content. That means member engagement in Facebook Groups is generally low \u2013 and monetizing your community using Facebook alone is hard.\nIn recent years, Facebook has also faced many challenges ranging from usability, data privacy issues, and ownership. So while it can be really useful to get your community started, it\u2019s best to use it with another online community platform that gives you more control and security.\nFacebook\u2019s key features:\nSeamless integration with the Facebook ecosystem (Messenger, Meta, etc.)\nTrack growth and engagement with an insights dashboard\nExceptional international accessibility\nFacebook\u2019s G2 rating: 4.3/5\nFacebook pricing:\nFacebook groups are free for all account holders to use. This combined with its exceptional ubiquity makes it one of the best free online community platforms on the market.\nRelated: The best Facebook Group Alternatives\nSlack\nSlack isn\u2019t just a work chat \u2013 it\u2019s also an easy way to organize a community online. The free plan allows you to add unlimited community members to the platform but caps visible messages to 10,000 (they can be viewed by subscribing to a paid plan). Paid plans allow for more storage, app integrations and group calls.\nOn Slack, direct messages are the name of the game and you can create channels to keep various topics neatly organized. Recently, Slack has added audio and video call features too.\nSlack is a great choice for anyone looking to keep the conversation going, but there are limited options to customize the platform to your brand.\nSlack\u2019s key features:\nUnlimited members\nDirect messaging\nWidely used\nSlack\u2019s G2 score: 4.5/5\nSlack\u2019s pricing:\nTo enjoy the features of a paid Slack plan, everyone in your community must pay for the same plan. You (the admin) can\u2019t just pay $7 for a few features. You must pay $7 for every member, all at once. Because of this, paid plans are almost never used beyond a corporate setting.\nHowever, Slack\u2019s free plan allows you to create a group and invite anyone to the community. You can enjoy basic features, putting this platform close behind Facebook in its running as one of the best free online community platforms.\n\u201cWhat I like best about Slack is how it simplifies team communication with its intuitive interface, organized channels, and seamless integrations with tools like Google Drive and Trello. It keeps conversations focused, reduces email clutter, and makes real-time collaboration effortless\u2026\u201d \u2013 Monica L.\nDiscord\nAnyone in the gaming community has heard of Discord \u2013 an instant messaging platform with support for voice calls, video calls, and chats.\nDiscord is free to use \u2013 users can choose whether to upgrade their account to a pro user, unlocking extra features. Like Slack, Discord is a good option for creating an online community based on instant and spontaneous chatting. The same user can belong to multiple communities, so creating a new online community is easy if your target audience is already using Discord.\nDiscord\u2019s key features:\nFree to use\nSimple chat-focused interface\nSet up separate channels\nDiscord\u2019s G2 score: Not rated\nDiscord\u2019s pricing: \nLike Facebook and Slack, Discord is another one of the best free online community platforms. Free for everyone. All you need to do is download it to get started.\nHowever, users can upgrade to Nitro Basic or Nitro for additional benefits that enhance the user experience.\nSkool\nSimilar to online course marketplaces like Skillshare or Udemy, Skool is a central hub for a vast catalog of online communities. Learners can find all kinds of communities ranging from financial literacy to influencer 101. Creators, on the other hand, can leverage all of the classic features one would expect from a community or course builder today.\nAs one of the best online community platforms in 2025, Skool makes it easy to set up your group in minutes. Offer paid or free communities, embed video, images, schedule live events, and gather emails for marketing automation. Retain and engage members with engagement features like a leaderboard or even levels, where certain achievements can unlock access to resources, coaching sessions, and more.\nSkool\u2019s key features:\nIntuitive community and course creation interface\nSkool gamification encourages community engagement\nSimple 1-plan pricing\nSkool\u2019s pricing:\nSkool is free for the first 14 days; after your trial expires, the monthly rate is $99. This plan allows for 1 group and grants access to all features, unlimited courses, and unlimited members.\nBettermode\nBettermode is one of the best platforms for online community because, for many creators, it\u2019s all they\u2019ll need to start and scale their communities. The platform contains valuable features, including member profiles, member roles, multiple log-in authentication routes, a flexible and customizable community structure, and so much more.\nUse the platform\u2019s pre-built templates to expedite your launch. Or, customize the start-up using Bettermode\u2019s array of customization tools, drag-and-drop builder, integrations/app library, or developer portal.\nBettermode\u2019s key features:\nDrag-and-drop builder makes creation a breeze, with the option to customize further using code\nA community analytics dashboard gives you insight into metrics like member growth, activity, unique daily visits, and more\nLeverage social login for near frictionless accessibility\nBettermode\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nBettermode\u2019s pricing:\nIn the platform\u2019s own words, the free plan is \u201cIdeal for hobbyists and individuals exploring web app creation.\u201d\nWith a cap of 10 members and 5 spaces, the free plan is effectively an untimed free trial. However, in an era where true free plans are disappearing, it\u2019s nice to see one that isn\u2019t limited to a small time frame.\nThe rest of Bettermode\u2019s pricing plans are as follows:\nFree ($0/month)\nLite ($24/month)\nPro ($59/month)\nBusiness ($119/month)\n\u201cMaking a cookie free, non-tracked community that looks better than the current iteration of mega-platforms without losing the community building features that matter. Profiles and member-to-member messaging make engagement between members easy.\nLots of features work well for product development and networks. The platform is a great option for a multi-passionate influencer or brand with multiple divisions and different audiences.\u201d \u2013 Shawneda C.\nKajabi\nKajabi is a well-rounded online community platform to help you grow your business with creative custom solutions.

Users can post messages and chat with each other on the platform, helping to build closer bonds in your community.\nNew posts are easy to create with an intuitive CMS and can include images, videos, audio, surveys and more. Users also have the option to engage with your content via a community app.\nMighty\u2019s key features:\nDirect messages between members\nCreate multimedia posts\nAdd unlimited admins and members\nMighty\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nMighty\u2019s pricing:\nThe Community Plan ($49/month)\nThe Courses Plan ($119/month)\nThe Business Plan ($219/month)\nThe Path-to-Pro Plan ($430/month)\nMighty Pro (custom pricing)\n\u201cOne of the standout features of Mighty Networks is its robust community-building capabilities. The platform allows users to create engaging online communities with tools for rich media posts, events, and online courses, all tailored to foster interaction among members.\u201d \u2013 Jayson B.\nRelated: Thinkific vs Mighty Networks \u2013 A detailed comparison\nFacebook Groups\nMost of your community \u2013 regardless of demographics \u2013 probably have a Facebook profile already. This makes Facebook Groups an easy choice when considering a new online community platform. Users can simply log in to their Facebook and join your group \u2013 it\u2019s that simple.\nFacebook Groups are completely free to use \u2013 but the downside is that most members won\u2019t see your posts in their activity feed, so they\u2019ll need to visit the group directly to engage with your content. That means member engagement in Facebook Groups is generally low \u2013 and monetizing your community using Facebook alone is hard.\nIn recent years, Facebook has also faced many challenges ranging from usability, data privacy issues, and ownership. So while it can be really useful to get your community started, it\u2019s best to use it with another online community platform that gives you more control and security.\nFacebook\u2019s key features:\nSeamless integration with the Facebook ecosystem (Messenger, Meta, etc.)\nTrack growth and engagement with an insights dashboard\nExceptional international accessibility\nFacebook\u2019s G2 rating: 4.3/5\nFacebook pricing:\nFacebook groups are free for all account holders to use. This combined with its exceptional ubiquity makes it one of the best free online community platforms on the market.\nRelated: The best Facebook Group Alternatives\nSlack\nSlack isn\u2019t just a work chat \u2013 it\u2019s also an easy way to organize a community online. The free plan allows you to add unlimited community members to the platform but caps visible messages to 10,000 (they can be viewed by subscribing to a paid plan). Paid plans allow for more storage, app integrations and group calls.\nOn Slack, direct messages are the name of the game and you can create channels to keep various topics neatly organized. Recently, Slack has added audio and video call features too.\nSlack is a great choice for anyone looking to keep the conversation going, but there are limited options to customize the platform to your brand.\nSlack\u2019s key features:\nUnlimited members\nDirect messaging\nWidely used\nSlack\u2019s G2 score: 4.5/5\nSlack\u2019s pricing:\nTo enjoy the features of a paid Slack plan, everyone in your community must pay for the same plan. You (the admin) can\u2019t just pay $7 for a few features. You must pay $7 for every member, all at once. Because of this, paid plans are almost never used beyond a corporate setting.\nHowever, Slack\u2019s free plan allows you to create a group and invite anyone to the community. You can enjoy basic features, putting this platform close behind Facebook in its running as one of the best free online community platforms.\n\u201cWhat I like best about Slack is how it simplifies team communication with its intuitive interface, organized channels, and seamless integrations with tools like Google Drive and Trello. It keeps conversations focused, reduces email clutter, and makes real-time collaboration effortless\u2026\u201d \u2013 Monica L.\nDiscord\nAnyone in the gaming community has heard of Discord \u2013 an instant messaging platform with support for voice calls, video calls, and chats.\nDiscord is free to use \u2013 users can choose whether to upgrade their account to a pro user, unlocking extra features. Like Slack, Discord is a good option for creating an online community based on instant and spontaneous chatting. The same user can belong to multiple communities, so creating a new online community is easy if your target audience is already using Discord.\nDiscord\u2019s key features:\nFree to use\nSimple chat-focused interface\nSet up separate channels\nDiscord\u2019s G2 score: Not rated\nDiscord\u2019s pricing: \nLike Facebook and Slack, Discord is another one of the best free online community platforms. Free for everyone. All you need to do is download it to get started.\nHowever, users can upgrade to Nitro Basic or Nitro for additional benefits that enhance the user experience.\nSkool\nSimilar to online course marketplaces like Skillshare or Udemy, Skool is a central hub for a vast catalog of online communities. Learners can find all kinds of communities ranging from financial literacy to influencer 101. Creators, on the other hand, can leverage all of the classic features one would expect from a community or course builder today.\nAs one of the best online community platforms in 2025, Skool makes it easy to set up your group in minutes. Offer paid or free communities, embed video, images, schedule live events, and gather emails for marketing automation. Retain and engage members with engagement features like a leaderboard or even levels, where certain achievements can unlock access to resources, coaching sessions, and more.\nSkool\u2019s key features:\nIntuitive community and course creation interface\nSkool gamification encourages community engagement\nSimple 1-plan pricing\nSkool\u2019s pricing:\nSkool is free for the first 14 days; after your trial expires, the monthly rate is $99. This plan allows for 1 group and grants access to all features, unlimited courses, and unlimited members.\nBettermode\nBettermode is one of the best platforms for online community because, for many creators, it\u2019s all they\u2019ll need to start and scale their communities. The platform contains valuable features, including member profiles, member roles, multiple log-in authentication routes, a flexible and customizable community structure, and so much more.\nUse the platform\u2019s pre-built templates to expedite your launch. Or, customize the start-up using Bettermode\u2019s array of customization tools, drag-and-drop builder, integrations/app library, or developer portal.\nBettermode\u2019s key features:\nDrag-and-drop builder makes creation a breeze, with the option to customize further using code\nA community analytics dashboard gives you insight into metrics like member growth, activity, unique daily visits, and more\nLeverage social login for near frictionless accessibility\nBettermode\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nBettermode\u2019s pricing:\nIn the platform\u2019s own words, the free plan is \u201cIdeal for hobbyists and individuals exploring web app creation.\u201d\nWith a cap of 10 members and 5 spaces, the free plan is effectively an untimed free trial. However, in an era where true free plans are disappearing, it\u2019s nice to see one that isn\u2019t limited to a small time frame.\nThe rest of Bettermode\u2019s pricing plans are as follows:\nFree ($0/month)\nLite ($24/month)\nPro ($59/month)\nBusiness ($119/month)\n\u201cMaking a cookie free, non-tracked community that looks better than the current iteration of mega-platforms without losing the community building features that matter. Profiles and member-to-member messaging make engagement between members easy.\nLots of features work well for product development and networks. The platform is a great option for a multi-passionate influencer or brand with multiple divisions and different audiences.\u201d \u2013 Shawneda C.\nKajabi\nKajabi is a well-rounded online community platform to help you grow your business with creative custom solutions.

Users can post messages and chat with each other on the platform, helping to build closer bonds in your community.\nNew posts are easy to create with an intuitive CMS and can include images, videos, audio, surveys and more. Users also have the option to engage with your content via a community app.\nMighty\u2019s key features:\nDirect messages between members\nCreate multimedia posts\nAdd unlimited admins and members\nMighty\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nMighty\u2019s pricing:\nThe Community Plan ($49/month)\nThe Courses Plan ($119/month)\nThe Business Plan ($219/month)\nThe Path-to-Pro Plan ($430/month)\nMighty Pro (custom pricing)\n\u201cOne of the standout features of Mighty Networks is its robust community-building capabilities. The platform allows users to create engaging online communities with tools for rich media posts, events, and online courses, all tailored to foster interaction among members.\u201d \u2013 Jayson B.\nRelated: Thinkific vs Mighty Networks \u2013 A detailed comparison\nFacebook Groups\nMost of your community \u2013 regardless of demographics \u2013 probably have a Facebook profile already. This makes Facebook Groups an easy choice when considering a new online community platform. Users can simply log in to their Facebook and join your group \u2013 it\u2019s that simple.\nFacebook Groups are completely free to use \u2013 but the downside is that most members won\u2019t see your posts in their activity feed, so they\u2019ll need to visit the group directly to engage with your content. That means member engagement in Facebook Groups is generally low \u2013 and monetizing your community using Facebook alone is hard.\nIn recent years, Facebook has also faced many challenges ranging from usability, data privacy issues, and ownership. So while it can be really useful to get your community started, it\u2019s best to use it with another online community platform that gives you more control and security.\nFacebook\u2019s key features:\nSeamless integration with the Facebook ecosystem (Messenger, Meta, etc.)\nTrack growth and engagement with an insights dashboard\nExceptional international accessibility\nFacebook\u2019s G2 rating: 4.3/5\nFacebook pricing:\nFacebook groups are free for all account holders to use. This combined with its exceptional ubiquity makes it one of the best free online community platforms on the market.\nRelated: The best Facebook Group Alternatives\nSlack\nSlack isn\u2019t just a work chat \u2013 it\u2019s also an easy way to organize a community online. The free plan allows you to add unlimited community members to the platform but caps visible messages to 10,000 (they can be viewed by subscribing to a paid plan). Paid plans allow for more storage, app integrations and group calls.\nOn Slack, direct messages are the name of the game and you can create channels to keep various topics neatly organized. Recently, Slack has added audio and video call features too.\nSlack is a great choice for anyone looking to keep the conversation going, but there are limited options to customize the platform to your brand.\nSlack\u2019s key features:\nUnlimited members\nDirect messaging\nWidely used\nSlack\u2019s G2 score: 4.5/5\nSlack\u2019s pricing:\nTo enjoy the features of a paid Slack plan, everyone in your community must pay for the same plan. You (the admin) can\u2019t just pay $7 for a few features. You must pay $7 for every member, all at once. Because of this, paid plans are almost never used beyond a corporate setting.\nHowever, Slack\u2019s free plan allows you to create a group and invite anyone to the community. You can enjoy basic features, putting this platform close behind Facebook in its running as one of the best free online community platforms.\n\u201cWhat I like best about Slack is how it simplifies team communication with its intuitive interface, organized channels, and seamless integrations with tools like Google Drive and Trello. It keeps conversations focused, reduces email clutter, and makes real-time collaboration effortless\u2026\u201d \u2013 Monica L.\nDiscord\nAnyone in the gaming community has heard of Discord \u2013 an instant messaging platform with support for voice calls, video calls, and chats.\nDiscord is free to use \u2013 users can choose whether to upgrade their account to a pro user, unlocking extra features. Like Slack, Discord is a good option for creating an online community based on instant and spontaneous chatting. The same user can belong to multiple communities, so creating a new online community is easy if your target audience is already using Discord.\nDiscord\u2019s key features:\nFree to use\nSimple chat-focused interface\nSet up separate channels\nDiscord\u2019s G2 score: Not rated\nDiscord\u2019s pricing: \nLike Facebook and Slack, Discord is another one of the best free online community platforms. Free for everyone. All you need to do is download it to get started.\nHowever, users can upgrade to Nitro Basic or Nitro for additional benefits that enhance the user experience.\nSkool\nSimilar to online course marketplaces like Skillshare or Udemy, Skool is a central hub for a vast catalog of online communities. Learners can find all kinds of communities ranging from financial literacy to influencer 101. Creators, on the other hand, can leverage all of the classic features one would expect from a community or course builder today.\nAs one of the best online community platforms in 2025, Skool makes it easy to set up your group in minutes. Offer paid or free communities, embed video, images, schedule live events, and gather emails for marketing automation. Retain and engage members with engagement features like a leaderboard or even levels, where certain achievements can unlock access to resources, coaching sessions, and more.\nSkool\u2019s key features:\nIntuitive community and course creation interface\nSkool gamification encourages community engagement\nSimple 1-plan pricing\nSkool\u2019s pricing:\nSkool is free for the first 14 days; after your trial expires, the monthly rate is $99. This plan allows for 1 group and grants access to all features, unlimited courses, and unlimited members.\nBettermode\nBettermode is one of the best platforms for online community because, for many creators, it\u2019s all they\u2019ll need to start and scale their communities. The platform contains valuable features, including member profiles, member roles, multiple log-in authentication routes, a flexible and customizable community structure, and so much more.\nUse the platform\u2019s pre-built templates to expedite your launch. Or, customize the start-up using Bettermode\u2019s array of customization tools, drag-and-drop builder, integrations/app library, or developer portal.\nBettermode\u2019s key features:\nDrag-and-drop builder makes creation a breeze, with the option to customize further using code\nA community analytics dashboard gives you insight into metrics like member growth, activity, unique daily visits, and more\nLeverage social login for near frictionless accessibility\nBettermode\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nBettermode\u2019s pricing:\nIn the platform\u2019s own words, the free plan is \u201cIdeal for hobbyists and individuals exploring web app creation.\u201d\nWith a cap of 10 members and 5 spaces, the free plan is effectively an untimed free trial. However, in an era where true free plans are disappearing, it\u2019s nice to see one that isn\u2019t limited to a small time frame.\nThe rest of Bettermode\u2019s pricing plans are as follows:\nFree ($0/month)\nLite ($24/month)\nPro ($59/month)\nBusiness ($119/month)\n\u201cMaking a cookie free, non-tracked community that looks better than the current iteration of mega-platforms without losing the community building features that matter. Profiles and member-to-member messaging make engagement between members easy.\nLots of features work well for product development and networks. The platform is a great option for a multi-passionate influencer or brand with multiple divisions and different audiences.\u201d \u2013 Shawneda C.\nKajabi\nKajabi is a well-rounded online community platform to help you grow your business with creative custom solutions.

Users can post messages and chat with each other on the platform, helping to build closer bonds in your community.\nNew posts are easy to create with an intuitive CMS and can include images, videos, audio, surveys and more. Users also have the option to engage with your content via a community app.\nMighty\u2019s key features:\nDirect messages between members\nCreate multimedia posts\nAdd unlimited admins and members\nMighty\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nMighty\u2019s pricing:\nThe Community Plan ($49/month)\nThe Courses Plan ($119/month)\nThe Business Plan ($219/month)\nThe Path-to-Pro Plan ($430/month)\nMighty Pro (custom pricing)\n\u201cOne of the standout features of Mighty Networks is its robust community-building capabilities. The platform allows users to create engaging online communities with tools for rich media posts, events, and online courses, all tailored to foster interaction among members.\u201d \u2013 Jayson B.\nRelated: Thinkific vs Mighty Networks \u2013 A detailed comparison\nFacebook Groups\nMost of your community \u2013 regardless of demographics \u2013 probably have a Facebook profile already. This makes Facebook Groups an easy choice when considering a new online community platform. Users can simply log in to their Facebook and join your group \u2013 it\u2019s that simple.\nFacebook Groups are completely free to use \u2013 but the downside is that most members won\u2019t see your posts in their activity feed, so they\u2019ll need to visit the group directly to engage with your content. That means member engagement in Facebook Groups is generally low \u2013 and monetizing your community using Facebook alone is hard.\nIn recent years, Facebook has also faced many challenges ranging from usability, data privacy issues, and ownership. So while it can be really useful to get your community started, it\u2019s best to use it with another online community platform that gives you more control and security.\nFacebook\u2019s key features:\nSeamless integration with the Facebook ecosystem (Messenger, Meta, etc.)\nTrack growth and engagement with an insights dashboard\nExceptional international accessibility\nFacebook\u2019s G2 rating: 4.3/5\nFacebook pricing:\nFacebook groups are free for all account holders to use. This combined with its exceptional ubiquity makes it one of the best free online community platforms on the market.\nRelated: The best Facebook Group Alternatives\nSlack\nSlack isn\u2019t just a work chat \u2013 it\u2019s also an easy way to organize a community online. The free plan allows you to add unlimited community members to the platform but caps visible messages to 10,000 (they can be viewed by subscribing to a paid plan). Paid plans allow for more storage, app integrations and group calls.\nOn Slack, direct messages are the name of the game and you can create channels to keep various topics neatly organized. Recently, Slack has added audio and video call features too.\nSlack is a great choice for anyone looking to keep the conversation going, but there are limited options to customize the platform to your brand.\nSlack\u2019s key features:\nUnlimited members\nDirect messaging\nWidely used\nSlack\u2019s G2 score: 4.5/5\nSlack\u2019s pricing:\nTo enjoy the features of a paid Slack plan, everyone in your community must pay for the same plan. You (the admin) can\u2019t just pay $7 for a few features. You must pay $7 for every member, all at once. Because of this, paid plans are almost never used beyond a corporate setting.\nHowever, Slack\u2019s free plan allows you to create a group and invite anyone to the community. You can enjoy basic features, putting this platform close behind Facebook in its running as one of the best free online community platforms.\n\u201cWhat I like best about Slack is how it simplifies team communication with its intuitive interface, organized channels, and seamless integrations with tools like Google Drive and Trello. It keeps conversations focused, reduces email clutter, and makes real-time collaboration effortless\u2026\u201d \u2013 Monica L.\nDiscord\nAnyone in the gaming community has heard of Discord \u2013 an instant messaging platform with support for voice calls, video calls, and chats.\nDiscord is free to use \u2013 users can choose whether to upgrade their account to a pro user, unlocking extra features. Like Slack, Discord is a good option for creating an online community based on instant and spontaneous chatting. The same user can belong to multiple communities, so creating a new online community is easy if your target audience is already using Discord.\nDiscord\u2019s key features:\nFree to use\nSimple chat-focused interface\nSet up separate channels\nDiscord\u2019s G2 score: Not rated\nDiscord\u2019s pricing: \nLike Facebook and Slack, Discord is another one of the best free online community platforms. Free for everyone. All you need to do is download it to get started.\nHowever, users can upgrade to Nitro Basic or Nitro for additional benefits that enhance the user experience.\nSkool\nSimilar to online course marketplaces like Skillshare or Udemy, Skool is a central hub for a vast catalog of online communities. Learners can find all kinds of communities ranging from financial literacy to influencer 101. Creators, on the other hand, can leverage all of the classic features one would expect from a community or course builder today.\nAs one of the best online community platforms in 2025, Skool makes it easy to set up your group in minutes. Offer paid or free communities, embed video, images, schedule live events, and gather emails for marketing automation. Retain and engage members with engagement features like a leaderboard or even levels, where certain achievements can unlock access to resources, coaching sessions, and more.\nSkool\u2019s key features:\nIntuitive community and course creation interface\nSkool gamification encourages community engagement\nSimple 1-plan pricing\nSkool\u2019s pricing:\nSkool is free for the first 14 days; after your trial expires, the monthly rate is $99. This plan allows for 1 group and grants access to all features, unlimited courses, and unlimited members.\nBettermode\nBettermode is one of the best platforms for online community because, for many creators, it\u2019s all they\u2019ll need to start and scale their communities. The platform contains valuable features, including member profiles, member roles, multiple log-in authentication routes, a flexible and customizable community structure, and so much more.\nUse the platform\u2019s pre-built templates to expedite your launch. Or, customize the start-up using Bettermode\u2019s array of customization tools, drag-and-drop builder, integrations/app library, or developer portal.\nBettermode\u2019s key features:\nDrag-and-drop builder makes creation a breeze, with the option to customize further using code\nA community analytics dashboard gives you insight into metrics like member growth, activity, unique daily visits, and more\nLeverage social login for near frictionless accessibility\nBettermode\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nBettermode\u2019s pricing:\nIn the platform\u2019s own words, the free plan is \u201cIdeal for hobbyists and individuals exploring web app creation.\u201d\nWith a cap of 10 members and 5 spaces, the free plan is effectively an untimed free trial. However, in an era where true free plans are disappearing, it\u2019s nice to see one that isn\u2019t limited to a small time frame.\nThe rest of Bettermode\u2019s pricing plans are as follows:\nFree ($0/month)\nLite ($24/month)\nPro ($59/month)\nBusiness ($119/month)\n\u201cMaking a cookie free, non-tracked community that looks better than the current iteration of mega-platforms without losing the community building features that matter. Profiles and member-to-member messaging make engagement between members easy.\nLots of features work well for product development and networks. The platform is a great option for a multi-passionate influencer or brand with multiple divisions and different audiences.\u201d \u2013 Shawneda C.\nKajabi\nKajabi is a well-rounded online community platform to help you grow your business with creative custom solutions.

Users can post messages and chat with each other on the platform, helping to build closer bonds in your community.\nNew posts are easy to create with an intuitive CMS and can include images, videos, audio, surveys and more. Users also have the option to engage with your content via a community app.\nMighty\u2019s key features:\nDirect messages between members\nCreate multimedia posts\nAdd unlimited admins and members\nMighty\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nMighty\u2019s pricing:\nThe Community Plan ($49/month)\nThe Courses Plan ($119/month)\nThe Business Plan ($219/month)\nThe Path-to-Pro Plan ($430/month)\nMighty Pro (custom pricing)\n\u201cOne of the standout features of Mighty Networks is its robust community-building capabilities. The platform allows users to create engaging online communities with tools for rich media posts, events, and online courses, all tailored to foster interaction among members.\u201d \u2013 Jayson B.\nRelated: Thinkific vs Mighty Networks \u2013 A detailed comparison\nFacebook Groups\nMost of your community \u2013 regardless of demographics \u2013 probably have a Facebook profile already. This makes Facebook Groups an easy choice when considering a new online community platform. Users can simply log in to their Facebook and join your group \u2013 it\u2019s that simple.\nFacebook Groups are completely free to use \u2013 but the downside is that most members won\u2019t see your posts in their activity feed, so they\u2019ll need to visit the group directly to engage with your content. That means member engagement in Facebook Groups is generally low \u2013 and monetizing your community using Facebook alone is hard.\nIn recent years, Facebook has also faced many challenges ranging from usability, data privacy issues, and ownership. So while it can be really useful to get your community started, it\u2019s best to use it with another online community platform that gives you more control and security.\nFacebook\u2019s key features:\nSeamless integration with the Facebook ecosystem (Messenger, Meta, etc.)\nTrack growth and engagement with an insights dashboard\nExceptional international accessibility\nFacebook\u2019s G2 rating: 4.3/5\nFacebook pricing:\nFacebook groups are free for all account holders to use. This combined with its exceptional ubiquity makes it one of the best free online community platforms on the market.\nRelated: The best Facebook Group Alternatives\nSlack\nSlack isn\u2019t just a work chat \u2013 it\u2019s also an easy way to organize a community online. The free plan allows you to add unlimited community members to the platform but caps visible messages to 10,000 (they can be viewed by subscribing to a paid plan). Paid plans allow for more storage, app integrations and group calls.\nOn Slack, direct messages are the name of the game and you can create channels to keep various topics neatly organized. Recently, Slack has added audio and video call features too.\nSlack is a great choice for anyone looking to keep the conversation going, but there are limited options to customize the platform to your brand.\nSlack\u2019s key features:\nUnlimited members\nDirect messaging\nWidely used\nSlack\u2019s G2 score: 4.5/5\nSlack\u2019s pricing:\nTo enjoy the features of a paid Slack plan, everyone in your community must pay for the same plan. You (the admin) can\u2019t just pay $7 for a few features. You must pay $7 for every member, all at once. Because of this, paid plans are almost never used beyond a corporate setting.\nHowever, Slack\u2019s free plan allows you to create a group and invite anyone to the community. You can enjoy basic features, putting this platform close behind Facebook in its running as one of the best free online community platforms.\n\u201cWhat I like best about Slack is how it simplifies team communication with its intuitive interface, organized channels, and seamless integrations with tools like Google Drive and Trello. It keeps conversations focused, reduces email clutter, and makes real-time collaboration effortless\u2026\u201d \u2013 Monica L.\nDiscord\nAnyone in the gaming community has heard of Discord \u2013 an instant messaging platform with support for voice calls, video calls, and chats.\nDiscord is free to use \u2013 users can choose whether to upgrade their account to a pro user, unlocking extra features. Like Slack, Discord is a good option for creating an online community based on instant and spontaneous chatting. The same user can belong to multiple communities, so creating a new online community is easy if your target audience is already using Discord.\nDiscord\u2019s key features:\nFree to use\nSimple chat-focused interface\nSet up separate channels\nDiscord\u2019s G2 score: Not rated\nDiscord\u2019s pricing: \nLike Facebook and Slack, Discord is another one of the best free online community platforms. Free for everyone. All you need to do is download it to get started.\nHowever, users can upgrade to Nitro Basic or Nitro for additional benefits that enhance the user experience.\nSkool\nSimilar to online course marketplaces like Skillshare or Udemy, Skool is a central hub for a vast catalog of online communities. Learners can find all kinds of communities ranging from financial literacy to influencer 101. Creators, on the other hand, can leverage all of the classic features one would expect from a community or course builder today.\nAs one of the best online community platforms in 2025, Skool makes it easy to set up your group in minutes. Offer paid or free communities, embed video, images, schedule live events, and gather emails for marketing automation. Retain and engage members with engagement features like a leaderboard or even levels, where certain achievements can unlock access to resources, coaching sessions, and more.\nSkool\u2019s key features:\nIntuitive community and course creation interface\nSkool gamification encourages community engagement\nSimple 1-plan pricing\nSkool\u2019s pricing:\nSkool is free for the first 14 days; after your trial expires, the monthly rate is $99. This plan allows for 1 group and grants access to all features, unlimited courses, and unlimited members.\nBettermode\nBettermode is one of the best platforms for online community because, for many creators, it\u2019s all they\u2019ll need to start and scale their communities. The platform contains valuable features, including member profiles, member roles, multiple log-in authentication routes, a flexible and customizable community structure, and so much more.\nUse the platform\u2019s pre-built templates to expedite your launch. Or, customize the start-up using Bettermode\u2019s array of customization tools, drag-and-drop builder, integrations/app library, or developer portal.\nBettermode\u2019s key features:\nDrag-and-drop builder makes creation a breeze, with the option to customize further using code\nA community analytics dashboard gives you insight into metrics like member growth, activity, unique daily visits, and more\nLeverage social login for near frictionless accessibility\nBettermode\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nBettermode\u2019s pricing:\nIn the platform\u2019s own words, the free plan is \u201cIdeal for hobbyists and individuals exploring web app creation.\u201d\nWith a cap of 10 members and 5 spaces, the free plan is effectively an untimed free trial. However, in an era where true free plans are disappearing, it\u2019s nice to see one that isn\u2019t limited to a small time frame.\nThe rest of Bettermode\u2019s pricing plans are as follows:\nFree ($0/month)\nLite ($24/month)\nPro ($59/month)\nBusiness ($119/month)\n\u201cMaking a cookie free, non-tracked community that looks better than the current iteration of mega-platforms without losing the community building features that matter. Profiles and member-to-member messaging make engagement between members easy.\nLots of features work well for product development and networks. The platform is a great option for a multi-passionate influencer or brand with multiple divisions and different audiences.\u201d \u2013 Shawneda C.\nKajabi\nKajabi is a well-rounded online community platform to help you grow your business with creative custom solutions.

Users can post messages and chat with each other on the platform, helping to build closer bonds in your community.\nNew posts are easy to create with an intuitive CMS and can include images, videos, audio, surveys and more. Users also have the option to engage with your content via a community app.\nMighty\u2019s key features:\nDirect messages between members\nCreate multimedia posts\nAdd unlimited admins and members\nMighty\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nMighty\u2019s pricing:\nThe Community Plan ($49/month)\nThe Courses Plan ($119/month)\nThe Business Plan ($219/month)\nThe Path-to-Pro Plan ($430/month)\nMighty Pro (custom pricing)\n\u201cOne of the standout features of Mighty Networks is its robust community-building capabilities. The platform allows users to create engaging online communities with tools for rich media posts, events, and online courses, all tailored to foster interaction among members.\u201d \u2013 Jayson B.\nRelated: Thinkific vs Mighty Networks \u2013 A detailed comparison\nFacebook Groups\nMost of your community \u2013 regardless of demographics \u2013 probably have a Facebook profile already. This makes Facebook Groups an easy choice when considering a new online community platform. Users can simply log in to their Facebook and join your group \u2013 it\u2019s that simple.\nFacebook Groups are completely free to use \u2013 but the downside is that most members won\u2019t see your posts in their activity feed, so they\u2019ll need to visit the group directly to engage with your content. That means member engagement in Facebook Groups is generally low \u2013 and monetizing your community using Facebook alone is hard.\nIn recent years, Facebook has also faced many challenges ranging from usability, data privacy issues, and ownership. So while it can be really useful to get your community started, it\u2019s best to use it with another online community platform that gives you more control and security.\nFacebook\u2019s key features:\nSeamless integration with the Facebook ecosystem (Messenger, Meta, etc.)\nTrack growth and engagement with an insights dashboard\nExceptional international accessibility\nFacebook\u2019s G2 rating: 4.3/5\nFacebook pricing:\nFacebook groups are free for all account holders to use. This combined with its exceptional ubiquity makes it one of the best free online community platforms on the market.\nRelated: The best Facebook Group Alternatives\nSlack\nSlack isn\u2019t just a work chat \u2013 it\u2019s also an easy way to organize a community online. The free plan allows you to add unlimited community members to the platform but caps visible messages to 10,000 (they can be viewed by subscribing to a paid plan). Paid plans allow for more storage, app integrations and group calls.\nOn Slack, direct messages are the name of the game and you can create channels to keep various topics neatly organized. Recently, Slack has added audio and video call features too.\nSlack is a great choice for anyone looking to keep the conversation going, but there are limited options to customize the platform to your brand.\nSlack\u2019s key features:\nUnlimited members\nDirect messaging\nWidely used\nSlack\u2019s G2 score: 4.5/5\nSlack\u2019s pricing:\nTo enjoy the features of a paid Slack plan, everyone in your community must pay for the same plan. You (the admin) can\u2019t just pay $7 for a few features. You must pay $7 for every member, all at once. Because of this, paid plans are almost never used beyond a corporate setting.\nHowever, Slack\u2019s free plan allows you to create a group and invite anyone to the community. You can enjoy basic features, putting this platform close behind Facebook in its running as one of the best free online community platforms.\n\u201cWhat I like best about Slack is how it simplifies team communication with its intuitive interface, organized channels, and seamless integrations with tools like Google Drive and Trello. It keeps conversations focused, reduces email clutter, and makes real-time collaboration effortless\u2026\u201d \u2013 Monica L.\nDiscord\nAnyone in the gaming community has heard of Discord \u2013 an instant messaging platform with support for voice calls, video calls, and chats.\nDiscord is free to use \u2013 users can choose whether to upgrade their account to a pro user, unlocking extra features. Like Slack, Discord is a good option for creating an online community based on instant and spontaneous chatting. The same user can belong to multiple communities, so creating a new online community is easy if your target audience is already using Discord.\nDiscord\u2019s key features:\nFree to use\nSimple chat-focused interface\nSet up separate channels\nDiscord\u2019s G2 score: Not rated\nDiscord\u2019s pricing: \nLike Facebook and Slack, Discord is another one of the best free online community platforms. Free for everyone. All you need to do is download it to get started.\nHowever, users can upgrade to Nitro Basic or Nitro for additional benefits that enhance the user experience.\nSkool\nSimilar to online course marketplaces like Skillshare or Udemy, Skool is a central hub for a vast catalog of online communities. Learners can find all kinds of communities ranging from financial literacy to influencer 101. Creators, on the other hand, can leverage all of the classic features one would expect from a community or course builder today.\nAs one of the best online community platforms in 2025, Skool makes it easy to set up your group in minutes. Offer paid or free communities, embed video, images, schedule live events, and gather emails for marketing automation. Retain and engage members with engagement features like a leaderboard or even levels, where certain achievements can unlock access to resources, coaching sessions, and more.\nSkool\u2019s key features:\nIntuitive community and course creation interface\nSkool gamification encourages community engagement\nSimple 1-plan pricing\nSkool\u2019s pricing:\nSkool is free for the first 14 days; after your trial expires, the monthly rate is $99. This plan allows for 1 group and grants access to all features, unlimited courses, and unlimited members.\nBettermode\nBettermode is one of the best platforms for online community because, for many creators, it\u2019s all they\u2019ll need to start and scale their communities. The platform contains valuable features, including member profiles, member roles, multiple log-in authentication routes, a flexible and customizable community structure, and so much more.\nUse the platform\u2019s pre-built templates to expedite your launch. Or, customize the start-up using Bettermode\u2019s array of customization tools, drag-and-drop builder, integrations/app library, or developer portal.\nBettermode\u2019s key features:\nDrag-and-drop builder makes creation a breeze, with the option to customize further using code\nA community analytics dashboard gives you insight into metrics like member growth, activity, unique daily visits, and more\nLeverage social login for near frictionless accessibility\nBettermode\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nBettermode\u2019s pricing:\nIn the platform\u2019s own words, the free plan is \u201cIdeal for hobbyists and individuals exploring web app creation.\u201d\nWith a cap of 10 members and 5 spaces, the free plan is effectively an untimed free trial. However, in an era where true free plans are disappearing, it\u2019s nice to see one that isn\u2019t limited to a small time frame.\nThe rest of Bettermode\u2019s pricing plans are as follows:\nFree ($0/month)\nLite ($24/month)\nPro ($59/month)\nBusiness ($119/month)\n\u201cMaking a cookie free, non-tracked community that looks better than the current iteration of mega-platforms without losing the community building features that matter. Profiles and member-to-member messaging make engagement between members easy.\nLots of features work well for product development and networks. The platform is a great option for a multi-passionate influencer or brand with multiple divisions and different audiences.\u201d \u2013 Shawneda C.\nKajabi\nKajabi is a well-rounded online community platform to help you grow your business with creative custom solutions.

Users can post messages and chat with each other on the platform, helping to build closer bonds in your community.\nNew posts are easy to create with an intuitive CMS and can include images, videos, audio, surveys and more. Users also have the option to engage with your content via a community app.\nMighty\u2019s key features:\nDirect messages between members\nCreate multimedia posts\nAdd unlimited admins and members\nMighty\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nMighty\u2019s pricing:\nThe Community Plan ($49/month)\nThe Courses Plan ($119/month)\nThe Business Plan ($219/month)\nThe Path-to-Pro Plan ($430/month)\nMighty Pro (custom pricing)\n\u201cOne of the standout features of Mighty Networks is its robust community-building capabilities. The platform allows users to create engaging online communities with tools for rich media posts, events, and online courses, all tailored to foster interaction among members.\u201d \u2013 Jayson B.\nRelated: Thinkific vs Mighty Networks \u2013 A detailed comparison\nFacebook Groups\nMost of your community \u2013 regardless of demographics \u2013 probably have a Facebook profile already. This makes Facebook Groups an easy choice when considering a new online community platform. Users can simply log in to their Facebook and join your group \u2013 it\u2019s that simple.\nFacebook Groups are completely free to use \u2013 but the downside is that most members won\u2019t see your posts in their activity feed, so they\u2019ll need to visit the group directly to engage with your content. That means member engagement in Facebook Groups is generally low \u2013 and monetizing your community using Facebook alone is hard.\nIn recent years, Facebook has also faced many challenges ranging from usability, data privacy issues, and ownership. So while it can be really useful to get your community started, it\u2019s best to use it with another online community platform that gives you more control and security.\nFacebook\u2019s key features:\nSeamless integration with the Facebook ecosystem (Messenger, Meta, etc.)\nTrack growth and engagement with an insights dashboard\nExceptional international accessibility\nFacebook\u2019s G2 rating: 4.3/5\nFacebook pricing:\nFacebook groups are free for all account holders to use. This combined with its exceptional ubiquity makes it one of the best free online community platforms on the market.\nRelated: The best Facebook Group Alternatives\nSlack\nSlack isn\u2019t just a work chat \u2013 it\u2019s also an easy way to organize a community online. The free plan allows you to add unlimited community members to the platform but caps visible messages to 10,000 (they can be viewed by subscribing to a paid plan). Paid plans allow for more storage, app integrations and group calls.\nOn Slack, direct messages are the name of the game and you can create channels to keep various topics neatly organized. Recently, Slack has added audio and video call features too.\nSlack is a great choice for anyone looking to keep the conversation going, but there are limited options to customize the platform to your brand.\nSlack\u2019s key features:\nUnlimited members\nDirect messaging\nWidely used\nSlack\u2019s G2 score: 4.5/5\nSlack\u2019s pricing:\nTo enjoy the features of a paid Slack plan, everyone in your community must pay for the same plan. You (the admin) can\u2019t just pay $7 for a few features. You must pay $7 for every member, all at once. Because of this, paid plans are almost never used beyond a corporate setting.\nHowever, Slack\u2019s free plan allows you to create a group and invite anyone to the community. You can enjoy basic features, putting this platform close behind Facebook in its running as one of the best free online community platforms.\n\u201cWhat I like best about Slack is how it simplifies team communication with its intuitive interface, organized channels, and seamless integrations with tools like Google Drive and Trello. It keeps conversations focused, reduces email clutter, and makes real-time collaboration effortless\u2026\u201d \u2013 Monica L.\nDiscord\nAnyone in the gaming community has heard of Discord \u2013 an instant messaging platform with support for voice calls, video calls, and chats.\nDiscord is free to use \u2013 users can choose whether to upgrade their account to a pro user, unlocking extra features. Like Slack, Discord is a good option for creating an online community based on instant and spontaneous chatting. The same user can belong to multiple communities, so creating a new online community is easy if your target audience is already using Discord.\nDiscord\u2019s key features:\nFree to use\nSimple chat-focused interface\nSet up separate channels\nDiscord\u2019s G2 score: Not rated\nDiscord\u2019s pricing: \nLike Facebook and Slack, Discord is another one of the best free online community platforms. Free for everyone. All you need to do is download it to get started.\nHowever, users can upgrade to Nitro Basic or Nitro for additional benefits that enhance the user experience.\nSkool\nSimilar to online course marketplaces like Skillshare or Udemy, Skool is a central hub for a vast catalog of online communities. Learners can find all kinds of communities ranging from financial literacy to influencer 101. Creators, on the other hand, can leverage all of the classic features one would expect from a community or course builder today.\nAs one of the best online community platforms in 2025, Skool makes it easy to set up your group in minutes. Offer paid or free communities, embed video, images, schedule live events, and gather emails for marketing automation. Retain and engage members with engagement features like a leaderboard or even levels, where certain achievements can unlock access to resources, coaching sessions, and more.\nSkool\u2019s key features:\nIntuitive community and course creation interface\nSkool gamification encourages community engagement\nSimple 1-plan pricing\nSkool\u2019s pricing:\nSkool is free for the first 14 days; after your trial expires, the monthly rate is $99. This plan allows for 1 group and grants access to all features, unlimited courses, and unlimited members.\nBettermode\nBettermode is one of the best platforms for online community because, for many creators, it\u2019s all they\u2019ll need to start and scale their communities. The platform contains valuable features, including member profiles, member roles, multiple log-in authentication routes, a flexible and customizable community structure, and so much more.\nUse the platform\u2019s pre-built templates to expedite your launch. Or, customize the start-up using Bettermode\u2019s array of customization tools, drag-and-drop builder, integrations/app library, or developer portal.\nBettermode\u2019s key features:\nDrag-and-drop builder makes creation a breeze, with the option to customize further using code\nA community analytics dashboard gives you insight into metrics like member growth, activity, unique daily visits, and more\nLeverage social login for near frictionless accessibility\nBettermode\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nBettermode\u2019s pricing:\nIn the platform\u2019s own words, the free plan is \u201cIdeal for hobbyists and individuals exploring web app creation.\u201d\nWith a cap of 10 members and 5 spaces, the free plan is effectively an untimed free trial. However, in an era where true free plans are disappearing, it\u2019s nice to see one that isn\u2019t limited to a small time frame.\nThe rest of Bettermode\u2019s pricing plans are as follows:\nFree ($0/month)\nLite ($24/month)\nPro ($59/month)\nBusiness ($119/month)\n\u201cMaking a cookie free, non-tracked community that looks better than the current iteration of mega-platforms without losing the community building features that matter. Profiles and member-to-member messaging make engagement between members easy.\nLots of features work well for product development and networks. The platform is a great option for a multi-passionate influencer or brand with multiple divisions and different audiences.\u201d \u2013 Shawneda C.\nKajabi\nKajabi is a well-rounded online community platform to help you grow your business with creative custom solutions.

Users can post messages and chat with each other on the platform, helping to build closer bonds in your community.\nNew posts are easy to create with an intuitive CMS and can include images, videos, audio, surveys and more. Users also have the option to engage with your content via a community app.\nMighty\u2019s key features:\nDirect messages between members\nCreate multimedia posts\nAdd unlimited admins and members\nMighty\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nMighty\u2019s pricing:\nThe Community Plan ($49/month)\nThe Courses Plan ($119/month)\nThe Business Plan ($219/month)\nThe Path-to-Pro Plan ($430/month)\nMighty Pro (custom pricing)\n\u201cOne of the standout features of Mighty Networks is its robust community-building capabilities. The platform allows users to create engaging online communities with tools for rich media posts, events, and online courses, all tailored to foster interaction among members.\u201d \u2013 Jayson B.\nRelated: Thinkific vs Mighty Networks \u2013 A detailed comparison\nFacebook Groups\nMost of your community \u2013 regardless of demographics \u2013 probably have a Facebook profile already. This makes Facebook Groups an easy choice when considering a new online community platform. Users can simply log in to their Facebook and join your group \u2013 it\u2019s that simple.\nFacebook Groups are completely free to use \u2013 but the downside is that most members won\u2019t see your posts in their activity feed, so they\u2019ll need to visit the group directly to engage with your content. That means member engagement in Facebook Groups is generally low \u2013 and monetizing your community using Facebook alone is hard.\nIn recent years, Facebook has also faced many challenges ranging from usability, data privacy issues, and ownership. So while it can be really useful to get your community started, it\u2019s best to use it with another online community platform that gives you more control and security.\nFacebook\u2019s key features:\nSeamless integration with the Facebook ecosystem (Messenger, Meta, etc.)\nTrack growth and engagement with an insights dashboard\nExceptional international accessibility\nFacebook\u2019s G2 rating: 4.3/5\nFacebook pricing:\nFacebook groups are free for all account holders to use. This combined with its exceptional ubiquity makes it one of the best free online community platforms on the market.\nRelated: The best Facebook Group Alternatives\nSlack\nSlack isn\u2019t just a work chat \u2013 it\u2019s also an easy way to organize a community online. The free plan allows you to add unlimited community members to the platform but caps visible messages to 10,000 (they can be viewed by subscribing to a paid plan). Paid plans allow for more storage, app integrations and group calls.\nOn Slack, direct messages are the name of the game and you can create channels to keep various topics neatly organized. Recently, Slack has added audio and video call features too.\nSlack is a great choice for anyone looking to keep the conversation going, but there are limited options to customize the platform to your brand.\nSlack\u2019s key features:\nUnlimited members\nDirect messaging\nWidely used\nSlack\u2019s G2 score: 4.5/5\nSlack\u2019s pricing:\nTo enjoy the features of a paid Slack plan, everyone in your community must pay for the same plan. You (the admin) can\u2019t just pay $7 for a few features. You must pay $7 for every member, all at once. Because of this, paid plans are almost never used beyond a corporate setting.\nHowever, Slack\u2019s free plan allows you to create a group and invite anyone to the community. You can enjoy basic features, putting this platform close behind Facebook in its running as one of the best free online community platforms.\n\u201cWhat I like best about Slack is how it simplifies team communication with its intuitive interface, organized channels, and seamless integrations with tools like Google Drive and Trello. It keeps conversations focused, reduces email clutter, and makes real-time collaboration effortless\u2026\u201d \u2013 Monica L.\nDiscord\nAnyone in the gaming community has heard of Discord \u2013 an instant messaging platform with support for voice calls, video calls, and chats.\nDiscord is free to use \u2013 users can choose whether to upgrade their account to a pro user, unlocking extra features. Like Slack, Discord is a good option for creating an online community based on instant and spontaneous chatting. The same user can belong to multiple communities, so creating a new online community is easy if your target audience is already using Discord.\nDiscord\u2019s key features:\nFree to use\nSimple chat-focused interface\nSet up separate channels\nDiscord\u2019s G2 score: Not rated\nDiscord\u2019s pricing: \nLike Facebook and Slack, Discord is another one of the best free online community platforms. Free for everyone. All you need to do is download it to get started.\nHowever, users can upgrade to Nitro Basic or Nitro for additional benefits that enhance the user experience.\nSkool\nSimilar to online course marketplaces like Skillshare or Udemy, Skool is a central hub for a vast catalog of online communities. Learners can find all kinds of communities ranging from financial literacy to influencer 101. Creators, on the other hand, can leverage all of the classic features one would expect from a community or course builder today.\nAs one of the best online community platforms in 2025, Skool makes it easy to set up your group in minutes. Offer paid or free communities, embed video, images, schedule live events, and gather emails for marketing automation. Retain and engage members with engagement features like a leaderboard or even levels, where certain achievements can unlock access to resources, coaching sessions, and more.\nSkool\u2019s key features:\nIntuitive community and course creation interface\nSkool gamification encourages community engagement\nSimple 1-plan pricing\nSkool\u2019s pricing:\nSkool is free for the first 14 days; after your trial expires, the monthly rate is $99. This plan allows for 1 group and grants access to all features, unlimited courses, and unlimited members.\nBettermode\nBettermode is one of the best platforms for online community because, for many creators, it\u2019s all they\u2019ll need to start and scale their communities. The platform contains valuable features, including member profiles, member roles, multiple log-in authentication routes, a flexible and customizable community structure, and so much more.\nUse the platform\u2019s pre-built templates to expedite your launch. Or, customize the start-up using Bettermode\u2019s array of customization tools, drag-and-drop builder, integrations/app library, or developer portal.\nBettermode\u2019s key features:\nDrag-and-drop builder makes creation a breeze, with the option to customize further using code\nA community analytics dashboard gives you insight into metrics like member growth, activity, unique daily visits, and more\nLeverage social login for near frictionless accessibility\nBettermode\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nBettermode\u2019s pricing:\nIn the platform\u2019s own words, the free plan is \u201cIdeal for hobbyists and individuals exploring web app creation.\u201d\nWith a cap of 10 members and 5 spaces, the free plan is effectively an untimed free trial. However, in an era where true free plans are disappearing, it\u2019s nice to see one that isn\u2019t limited to a small time frame.\nThe rest of Bettermode\u2019s pricing plans are as follows:\nFree ($0/month)\nLite ($24/month)\nPro ($59/month)\nBusiness ($119/month)\n\u201cMaking a cookie free, non-tracked community that looks better than the current iteration of mega-platforms without losing the community building features that matter. Profiles and member-to-member messaging make engagement between members easy.\nLots of features work well for product development and networks. The platform is a great option for a multi-passionate influencer or brand with multiple divisions and different audiences.\u201d \u2013 Shawneda C.\nKajabi\nKajabi is a well-rounded online community platform to help you grow your business with creative custom solutions.

Users can post messages and chat with each other on the platform, helping to build closer bonds in your community.\nNew posts are easy to create with an intuitive CMS and can include images, videos, audio, surveys and more. Users also have the option to engage with your content via a community app.\nMighty\u2019s key features:\nDirect messages between members\nCreate multimedia posts\nAdd unlimited admins and members\nMighty\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nMighty\u2019s pricing:\nThe Community Plan ($49/month)\nThe Courses Plan ($119/month)\nThe Business Plan ($219/month)\nThe Path-to-Pro Plan ($430/month)\nMighty Pro (custom pricing)\n\u201cOne of the standout features of Mighty Networks is its robust community-building capabilities. The platform allows users to create engaging online communities with tools for rich media posts, events, and online courses, all tailored to foster interaction among members.\u201d \u2013 Jayson B.\nRelated: Thinkific vs Mighty Networks \u2013 A detailed comparison\nFacebook Groups\nMost of your community \u2013 regardless of demographics \u2013 probably have a Facebook profile already. This makes Facebook Groups an easy choice when considering a new online community platform. Users can simply log in to their Facebook and join your group \u2013 it\u2019s that simple.\nFacebook Groups are completely free to use \u2013 but the downside is that most members won\u2019t see your posts in their activity feed, so they\u2019ll need to visit the group directly to engage with your content. That means member engagement in Facebook Groups is generally low \u2013 and monetizing your community using Facebook alone is hard.\nIn recent years, Facebook has also faced many challenges ranging from usability, data privacy issues, and ownership. So while it can be really useful to get your community started, it\u2019s best to use it with another online community platform that gives you more control and security.\nFacebook\u2019s key features:\nSeamless integration with the Facebook ecosystem (Messenger, Meta, etc.)\nTrack growth and engagement with an insights dashboard\nExceptional international accessibility\nFacebook\u2019s G2 rating: 4.3/5\nFacebook pricing:\nFacebook groups are free for all account holders to use. This combined with its exceptional ubiquity makes it one of the best free online community platforms on the market.\nRelated: The best Facebook Group Alternatives\nSlack\nSlack isn\u2019t just a work chat \u2013 it\u2019s also an easy way to organize a community online. The free plan allows you to add unlimited community members to the platform but caps visible messages to 10,000 (they can be viewed by subscribing to a paid plan). Paid plans allow for more storage, app integrations and group calls.\nOn Slack, direct messages are the name of the game and you can create channels to keep various topics neatly organized. Recently, Slack has added audio and video call features too.\nSlack is a great choice for anyone looking to keep the conversation going, but there are limited options to customize the platform to your brand.\nSlack\u2019s key features:\nUnlimited members\nDirect messaging\nWidely used\nSlack\u2019s G2 score: 4.5/5\nSlack\u2019s pricing:\nTo enjoy the features of a paid Slack plan, everyone in your community must pay for the same plan. You (the admin) can\u2019t just pay $7 for a few features. You must pay $7 for every member, all at once. Because of this, paid plans are almost never used beyond a corporate setting.\nHowever, Slack\u2019s free plan allows you to create a group and invite anyone to the community. You can enjoy basic features, putting this platform close behind Facebook in its running as one of the best free online community platforms.\n\u201cWhat I like best about Slack is how it simplifies team communication with its intuitive interface, organized channels, and seamless integrations with tools like Google Drive and Trello. It keeps conversations focused, reduces email clutter, and makes real-time collaboration effortless\u2026\u201d \u2013 Monica L.\nDiscord\nAnyone in the gaming community has heard of Discord \u2013 an instant messaging platform with support for voice calls, video calls, and chats.\nDiscord is free to use \u2013 users can choose whether to upgrade their account to a pro user, unlocking extra features. Like Slack, Discord is a good option for creating an online community based on instant and spontaneous chatting. The same user can belong to multiple communities, so creating a new online community is easy if your target audience is already using Discord.\nDiscord\u2019s key features:\nFree to use\nSimple chat-focused interface\nSet up separate channels\nDiscord\u2019s G2 score: Not rated\nDiscord\u2019s pricing: \nLike Facebook and Slack, Discord is another one of the best free online community platforms. Free for everyone. All you need to do is download it to get started.\nHowever, users can upgrade to Nitro Basic or Nitro for additional benefits that enhance the user experience.\nSkool\nSimilar to online course marketplaces like Skillshare or Udemy, Skool is a central hub for a vast catalog of online communities. Learners can find all kinds of communities ranging from financial literacy to influencer 101. Creators, on the other hand, can leverage all of the classic features one would expect from a community or course builder today.\nAs one of the best online community platforms in 2025, Skool makes it easy to set up your group in minutes. Offer paid or free communities, embed video, images, schedule live events, and gather emails for marketing automation. Retain and engage members with engagement features like a leaderboard or even levels, where certain achievements can unlock access to resources, coaching sessions, and more.\nSkool\u2019s key features:\nIntuitive community and course creation interface\nSkool gamification encourages community engagement\nSimple 1-plan pricing\nSkool\u2019s pricing:\nSkool is free for the first 14 days; after your trial expires, the monthly rate is $99. This plan allows for 1 group and grants access to all features, unlimited courses, and unlimited members.\nBettermode\nBettermode is one of the best platforms for online community because, for many creators, it\u2019s all they\u2019ll need to start and scale their communities. The platform contains valuable features, including member profiles, member roles, multiple log-in authentication routes, a flexible and customizable community structure, and so much more.\nUse the platform\u2019s pre-built templates to expedite your launch. Or, customize the start-up using Bettermode\u2019s array of customization tools, drag-and-drop builder, integrations/app library, or developer portal.\nBettermode\u2019s key features:\nDrag-and-drop builder makes creation a breeze, with the option to customize further using code\nA community analytics dashboard gives you insight into metrics like member growth, activity, unique daily visits, and more\nLeverage social login for near frictionless accessibility\nBettermode\u2019s G2 score: 4.6/5\nBettermode\u2019s pricing:\nIn the platform\u2019s own words, the free plan is \u201cIdeal for hobbyists and individuals exploring web app creation.\u201d\nWith a cap of 10 members and 5 spaces, the free plan is effectively an untimed free trial. However, in an era where true free plans are disappearing, it\u2019s nice to see one that isn\u2019t limited to a small time frame.\nThe rest of Bettermode\u2019s pricing plans are as follows:\nFree ($0/month)\nLite ($24/month)\nPro ($59/month)\nBusiness ($119/month)\n\u201cMaking a cookie free, non-tracked community that looks better than the current iteration of mega-platforms without losing the community building features that matter. Profiles and member-to-member messaging make engagement between members easy.\nLots of features work well for product development and networks. The platform is a great option for a multi-passionate influencer or brand with multiple divisions and different audiences.\u201d \u2013 Shawneda C.\nKajabi\nKajabi is a well-rounded online community platform to help you grow your business with creative custom solutions.

And brands and creators are building some AMAZING online community spaces, both free and monetized.\nBut to create an online community, you need a community platform that brings people together. And with so many options available in the market, it can be hard to know which one to choose.\nHere, we cover what makes a great community platform, what features to look for, and the best platform options to help you choose the right one.\nA community platform is a dedicated virtual space where people who share the same goals, interests, or motivations can connect and build relationships.\nThe best ones bring together content, community, courses, and commerce in one place \u2013 without having to mix and match software. And if you want to run a paid community, the platform needs membership business options like subscriptions, tiered memberships, payment gateways and more.\nThe ultimate goal of the online community software should really be to help people connect, make friends, and learn and grow together.\nHere\u2019s where the top players in the market stand.\nBEST FEATURES\nUSE FOR\nSTARTING FROM\n1.

For example, Discord is a great (and free) platform that\u2019s \u201cjust for fun,\u201d but you wouldn\u2019t build a digital business there.\nTo help you narrow down your options, we\u2019ve broken down the three types of online community software that people look for: enterprise (software that helps you build a community made up of customers or clients), digital business (to create community, and sell memberships and products you create), and personal (for making connections based on shared interests). Which of these descriptions apply to you?\nYOU NEED\nGOALS\nABOUT YOU\n1. Enterprise\nCustomization, branded apps, member management, community engine\nBuild brand loyalty, boost engagement, get data\nBuilding a brand community\n2. Digital Business\nMemberships, courses, events, & payments\nCreate a digital business\nBuilding a digital business\n3. Personal\nFree community platform, easy access\nConnect people with similar interests\nConnecting people for fun\nWhich of these descriptions apply to you?\nPro tip: Give yourself room to grow. If your small business takes off and you need to expand, start with a platform like Mighty that grows with you. You don't want to have to migrate a community if you don't need to.\nContent options (e.g. discussion posts, polls, surveys, and Q&As). A community thrives on content that your members create. The easier it is to create what they want to, the better this will be.\nOrganization. Flexible Spaces or subgroups. Not every member wants the same thing. Spaces let you organize people and content (ex. A course Space vs an event Space).\nAccessibility. Accessible on web, iOS, and Android apps. People can\u2019t always run to a PC to log on. (\u201cMobile friendly web apps\u201d don\u2019t cut it).\nBranded apps (under YOUR brand on iOS and Android). Established brands and businesses should consider branded community apps (that\u2019s YOUR app in the App Store and Google Play Store).\nAI & Automations: Look for an AI community platform\u2014software that puts your growth on auto-pilot by using automations and AI to deliver better results in less time!\nCourse platforms. If you have something to teach, make sure your community platform can host a live and/or pre-recorded course.\nLivestreaming and live events.\nMonetization. Multiple ways to monetize through events, paid memberships, subscriptions, and online courses.\nCommunity analytics & reporting. Get detailed member profiles about engagement and what is\u2014and isn\u2019t\u2014working within your community.\nIntegrations and Embeds for connecting to third-party tools (e.g., Zapier, Stripe, ConvertKit). No software does everything, so your community platform should easily integrate with the other relevant software you need.\nWhat are the best community platforms? Here are our top picks.\nRanked Best Online Community Platform by G2\nMighty Networks is G2\u2019s top-rated community management software and it powers $370 million in community businesses and brand communities.\nMighty mixes content, courses, community, commerce, and events on a platform that\u2019s intuitive yet powerful. Mighty is successful because of its people magic: online community software that\u2019s designed to create connections between members.\nHere are some of the community features Mighty gives you:\nThe ultimate content engine for anything you or your members want to create: short and long-form text, video, livestreams, polls & questions, and discussions.\nCreate courses (live or pre-recorded) and virtual events with built-in content creation software.\nBuilt-in community engagement tools\nCustomizable Spaces (virtual containers that we use to organize sub-communities) with features you can turn on or off. They can be public, private or paid.\nAI community management features with chat, messaging, and moderation tools.\nSoftware that makes people magic with AI: rich member profiles & profile assist, \u201cthings in common\u201d and conversation prompts, \u201cmake it better\u201d text editor, auto landing and sales pages, and more.\nSell memberships, courses, 1:1 or group coaching, masterminds, events, or bundle any of these in 135 different currencies. You can build memberships, bundles, one-time fees, and more.\nBuilt-in ConvertKit integration to mix the best community platform with the best email marketing platform + over 2,000 software embeds like Calendly, Dropbox, Spotify, Loom, Monday, and Notion.\nPricing\nStarts from $41/mo. Check our pricing page for more info.\nStart Your Free Trial\nBest Community Platform for Branded Apps\nIf you\u2019re an established brand or business, imagine saying, \u201cDownload our app!\u201d\nThat\u2019s what Mighty Pro does. And it adds to Mighty Networks\u2019 powerhouse community features:\nMighty Pro is the ultimate place to build member and customer communities on your own customizable branded app. You can even schedule a custom demo that includes your own app prototype, your preliminary launch plan, and a custom business case.\nSchedule a custom demo and we\u2019ll show you what we could build together! This includes your own app prototype, your preliminary launch plan, and a custom business case.\nLearn more about Mighty Pro\nInstead of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to create a custom app, choosing a white-label app that is fully customizable under your own brand will give you more for less.\nPricing\nLearn more about Mighty Pro\nBest free community platform\nDiscord is a community platform that\u2019s built for gamers, but hosts all kinds of free communities. It's got 150 million users. For its powerhouse features, plus its cool design and intuitive UX, Discord is the best free community platform on the market.\nDiscord has a community forum-type engine that supports different kinds of content, stickers, emojis, video, and more. But you can also livestream (+ screen share) and live chat.\nDiscord is perfect for free communities.\nBut it\u2019s not made for paid communities.\nDiscord did recently create a paid subscription offer, but it's limited to American users right now. It takes a 10% cut of your revenue and isn\u2019t robust enough to create a real community business. You can't really personalize Discord either.\nPros\nCons\nPricing\nBest free video chat platform\nGeneva is a community platform and chat app with chat rooms, forums, video, and audio-only rooms. It\u2019s great for hosting different kinds of video-based conversations. Geneva comes with an events calendar and virtual events (including RSVPs), application forms, moderation features, and the option to add admins. And it has DMs included for 1:1 conversations.\nGeneva has decent membership controls: admin roles and applications. And it has post rooms for content creators (although there are better content creator platforms).\nGeneva is free, which is great! But it\u2019s missing monetization features\u2013so it\u2019s not good for a paid community of any kind.\nAnd, while Geneva\u2019s video chat features are cool and it\u2019s good for organizing small groups, Geneva is not great for running large communities. And it\u2019s bad at introducing people who don\u2019t already know each other.\nGeneva knows this. And they\u2019ve doubled down on being the online hub for local, IRL communities. And they just got acquired by Bumble, so stay tuned to see where Geneva goes in the future.\nPros\nCons\nPricing\nBuilt for Alumni Management\nHivebrite is a community platform built specifically for alumni networks, although it can be used for other things. It includes a content management system to organize and publish content, dedicated subgroups where students and alumni can connect, a branded mobile app, and a job board feature.\nHivebrite also comes with a built-in event management system for in-person events, including calendars, invitation emails, ticketing, online payments, and integration with social networks. Finally, it can also run donor campaigns.\nThe downside to Hivebrite is that it\u2019s missing a virtual event feature, which means that if you want to get your alumni together for virtual meetings, coffee hours, or training sessions, you\u2019d need to pair it with a different event or virtual event app.\nAnd the community platform feels pretty dated; it\u2019s really just a simple forum.\nPros\nCons\nPricing\nBest Corporate Forum-Only Platform\nHigher Logic Vanilla is an online community platform for adding customer communities to corporate websites. It can be customized, and it has community management features. Members can publish content, create groups and subgroups, and add questions and polls.\nWhile Vanilla Forums offers companies a chance to build customer support and engagement, access to a knowledge base, and useful integrations, it is only a forum feature. It doesn\u2019t have options to sell memberships, subscriptions, or online courses. So, if you\u2019re looking for a community that you can monetize, this isn\u2019t the right choice for you.\nIt\u2019s the best fit for companies looking to add a free, branded forum to a website.\nPros\nCons\nPricing\nEnterprise Branded Apps\nDisciple is an enterprise community software with a community platform, and things like an activity feed, discussion forums, Q&As, and content creation\u2013text, videos, and images.\nLike others on this list, Disciple has member management tools, analytics, and even a built-in email feature. And it can be used to monetize with subscriptions or gated content (i.e. restricting content or access based on membership level).\nFinally, a Disciple community can be deployed on a branded mobile app. The app has features the website doesn\u2019t have, including livestreaming.\nUnfortunately, the app and the online community platform have different features and UX, so it's not a unified experience.\nPros\nCons\nPricing\nPrices start from \u00a338/mo for the first 100 members (web only), \u00a3499/mo to include a mobile app (and up to 500 members), and \u00a3833/mo for a white-label mobile app. And virtually every feature is an add-on.\nBest for Course Creators + Minimal Community Functions\nKajabi is well-known among course creators as a place to host an asynchronous course. It has an excellent course platform and marketing toolkit to sell courses with things like landing pages, email campaigns, and triggers.\nIn previous years, they weren\u2019t on this list because of the lack of community options. But with many course creators wanting course communities, Kajabi recently bought a company called Vibely to improve this feature.\nThe result is \"Community 2.0.,\" which moves Kajabi beyond a simple forum and adds a livestreaming feature and meet-ups. The new community feature is an improvement, but it\u2019s still awkward for UX--especially compared to alternatives. You need a separate login to access your community\u2013making it impossible to integrate well with a course. And if you wanted to teach a live course on Community 2.0, the LMS isn\u2019t integrated.\nIt ends up feeling a bit like 2 separate products, which is basically what it is.\nPros\nCons\nPricing\nThe Forum Platform for Corporations\nBettermode (formerly Tribe) is another white-label community platform for adding community spaces on brand websites. Its forum tool gives brands a place to create discussions, post content, and reach customers on a mobile app. The content options are flexible, you can add blogs, Q&As, and videos.\nOn Bettermode, customers can connect by asking questions, participating in polls, and posting images and videos. And these members can create profiles and you can assign member roles.\nYou won\u2019t get access to standard community features like connecting members by location or common interests, and more. There\u2019s no way to create and host online courses or live events, which limits how you can connect members.\nThis means Bettermode is best for a certain kind of community: a customer community on a corporate website.\nPros\nCons\nPricing\nCircle is a community platform with features like discussion forums, livestreaming and events, and different ways to create content. It also has member profiles that let your members showcase themselves and find like-minded people.\nCircle lets you create memberships and bundles, giving you a way to monetize your community. You can create spaces and dedicate them to either discussions, chat, courses, or events.\nThe downside to Circle is that you can\u2019t put multiple things in the same space, in contrast to Mighty Networks. You can\u2019t chat in an event space. You can\u2019t have a discussion in a course space. This segmentation can hurt engagement.\nWith additional costs to add many extras (things like admins, spaces, etc), it\u2019s a more costly option than an all-in-one like Mighty Networks.\nMany of Circle\u2019s features are also really early in development, with apps and courses added last year. They\u2019re still working the bugs out and it\u2019s hard to say how these features will fare long-term.\nPros\nCons\nPricing\nLet\u2019s talk Facebook Groups. Since Facebook has a huge user base, and it's free and easy to build a group, some people host communities there.\nIt might be a good place to start.\nAs far as free online communities built on social media platforms go, Facebook groups work okay.\nFor larger communities or paid membership communities, Facebook is probably not the right place to host though.\nBut if you\u2019re just starting out, or want a really simple and free community option, it can work.\nPros\nCons\nPricing\nSlack is a platform a lot of people know. Built for the workplace, it helps teams organize work.\nIt\u2019s got channel and messaging features and basic member profiles\u2013meaning it can host discussions. With mentions, different content features, and \u201chuddles\u201d for quick calls, it does have some of the features that make online communities work.\nBut, while you can build a community on Slack, in the big picture, it isn\u2019t great for online communities. It\u2019s got limited member roles and limited content types, and it lacks the types of features to build out a full community business (events, courses, content gating, etc.) Slack is also missing monetization, so you can\u2019t start a paid community on it.\nIt\u2019s basically like Discord. Most Hosts outgrow it OR find that their community fails from lack of engagement options. Let\u2019s not forget that Slack works for the virtual office because people HAVE to be there.\nPros\nCons\nPricing\nThe Community Platform for Nonprofits\nWild Apricot is a community management platform created for nonprofit organizations. It has community engagement and discussion tools. But it's really made to manage members in an organization or association.\nWith Wild Apricot, you can create, organize and manage your member databases, use the platform\u2019s website builder to create a professional-looking website, securely accept online payments, and manage virtual events. Plus, you can create subgroups for regional chapters, so that each can have its own website and community.\nThis software works great as a nonprofit membership platform. It's not great for paid, robust communities. And the design and UX is very dated.\nPros\nCons\nPricing\nBest Open-source Community Platform\nDiscourse is a community software with an open-source community code that they post for free on GitHub. Discourse gives you a discussion forum that\u2019s simple, but effective. You can organize conversations and replies, and add moderators.\nThe downside to Discourse is that you do need to pay for hosting somewhere. Discourse will do it for you, but it ends up starting from $50/mo, which is more expensive than several of the community platforms on this list.\nBasically, Discourse is an okay forum engine if you\u2019re a developer, but otherwise, you\u2019re better to go with an all-in-one that\u2019s done for you (and potentially cheaper).\nPros\nCons\nPricing\nBest WordPress Community Platform\nIf you\u2019re a diehard WordPress fan and looking for a community platform that\u2019s a WordPress plugin, you could look at Memberium. It works like a content gate, barring off sections of your site to make them members only, and includes a community component. You can also pair it with an LMS plugin like LearnDash if you want to add a course.\nPros\nCons\nPricing\nMemberful is another WordPress option. It\u2019s a plugin that turns your WordPress website into a basic membership platform, opening up the option to charge for a community. Memberful is not a community platform, however, but can be used to gate other community platforms like Discord and charge for access. It can also sell digital goods\u2013including online courses\u2013and even physical goods. And there are sales options like coupons, discounts, and promotions.\nAlthough you don\u2019t technically need WordPress to start a community with Memberful, it\u2019s weak as an all-around community platform. It\u2019s best as a plugin.\nPros\nCons\nPricing\nBuddyBoss is the last WordPress plugin we\u2019ll list here. It comes with the tools you need to add community dashboards, profiles, posts, comments, and messaging. And you can even add events, job boards, or an online store. If you want to add a course to this offering, you\u2019d need another plugin like LearnDash.\nPros\nCons\nPricing\nSkool is a new forum platform created by Sam Ovens. Recently, influencer Alex Hormozi has been heavily involved selling the platform too--he's part owner.\nSkool is really a community-style social media platform\u2013and people usually love it or hate it. It features really basic forums that feel something like reddit\u2013conversations you can join and respond to. There are also user profiles and a live event feature.\nThere are two things about Skool that seem to resonate with the people who like it.\nHowever, Skool has a lot of weak points which push it down this list.\nSkool encourages its Hosts to sign up other Hosts to the platform\u2013if someone gets you to join Skool through an affiliate link they earn 40% of your membership fees.\nPros\nCons\nPrice\nTelegram is something in between a community platform and social media, although it\u2019s better for broadcasting than turning strangers into friends. It does mix chat functions and email with the option to send files, voice, and video messages.\nThe main community feature Telegram has is its Channels: themed groups people can join. The admin(s) can broadcast up to 200,000 people.\nYou can monetize a Telegram channel with paid subscriptions\u2013although you need an integration to do it. And Telegram has good apps for all devices.\nTelegram doesn\u2019t let you build an interactive community where members can get to know each other. It\u2019s built for top-down broadcasting and messaging.\nPros\nCons\nPrice\nWe\u2019ll round out this list with LearnWorlds\u2013a great course platform with a basic community platform attached. LearnWorlds is a SCORM-compliant course platform with a website-builder attached. It also has some useful marketing tools, things like customer sales funnels, email, and affiliate programs.\nLearnWorlds has a good mobile app and you can livestream a course too.\nThe community functions as a generic discussion forum, and you can create Spaces for individual courses. For course businesses with multiple teachers and admins, the instructors can follow the discussions in their course Spaces without seeing the whole community. It's really basic as a community platform compared to its alternatives, but good as a course platform.\nPros\nCons\nPrice\nHere\u2019s a lightning quick guide to helping you figure out which of the platforms on this list is for you!\nAs more people build communities, more people come to realize that they\u2019ve started on the wrong platform. That\u2019s okay! Because moving a community is easier than it\u2019s ever been!\nCreators migrate for a lot of reasons, but most common are low engagement, missing key features (like apps or courses), struggles to use a platform, and cost.\nIf you\u2019re migrating, here\u2019s a sample roadmap:\nIf you\u2019re interested in migrating to Mighty, we have this form you can fill out to match you with the right plan and features.\nMove to Mighty\nThese 20 community platforms have different strengths and weaknesses. But there's something here for almost any type of community builder.\nTry it free for 14 days! No credit card required.\nStart Your Free Trial\nCreating space to belong & transform\nWhen you stop chasing customers, followers, subscribers, or whatever, and shift to the mindset of looking for members, it transforms what you're building.\nPeople are looking for places where they can feel like they belong. That\u2019s what an online community does at its best.\nAnd at a time when 1 in 4 people say they are \"very lonely,\" community is a human necessity.\nBut there's more.\nThe best communities often go through a transformation together.\nWhether it\u2019s the\u2026\nThe transformation journey is what makes communities work.\nThat\u2019s why we use something called a Big Purpose as a mission statement for your community. It\u2019s a rock-solid plan for the people you bring together and the transformation they achieve.\nThe ultimate business model\nWe\u2019ve watched thousands of communities grow and thrive. And we\u2019ve learned something about what it takes to turn a community into a 6-, 7- and even 8-figure digital business.\nIn fact, the greatest opportunity in the world is staring brands in the face. Your competitors probably aren\u2019t doing it.\nBrands that give people a place to belong have the ultimate competitive edge.\nAnd that\u2019s why online communities are so powerful. McKinsey even identified a community flywheel as the best business model for the 2020s. When brands build community, it\u2019s a flywheel. Members keep coming back and keep engaging, and selling becomes effortless.\nThink about it\u2026\nCommunity Hosts evolve into facilitators of self-driving membership communities. It's a business model like no other.\nHere are some examples from Mighty:\nThe platform is your secret weapon\nWhat role does community software play in creating spaces to belong? In creating businesses?\nThe single platform is where the magic happens. It\u2019s the operations. The tech stack.\nYour members engage with your platform every time they come on. In a perfect world, they don\u2019t think about the tech. And they definitely shouldn't fight with it. They just start connecting and creating.\nWhat happens when the community software gets in the way?\nBest-case scenario, you end up with frustrated users. Worst-case scenario, you end up with churn and angry ex-members.\nNobody wants that.\nThat\u2019s why the platform you choose really does matter.\nSince AI is the word on everyone\u2019s mind, how does AI fit in with community software? Not everyone has adopted it yet, but here's how we\u2019re using it.\nWe didn't just want AI to create more content. We asked, \"How can AI help us build better communities?\"\nAnd we started with one data point.\nWe can predict with 93% accuracy whether a community will succeed or fail. Communities succeed when members connect or collaborate with each other.\nCommunities don\u2019t just thrive because people show up. They thrive because people meet each other.\nSo we harnessed AI to make those meetings better\u2026\nAnd we automated the community-building process so that Mighty Co-Host\u2122 can get a community up and running in minutes.\nMighty\u2019s CEO, Gina Bianchini, wrote an article about this on LinkedIn if you want to read more!\nAs you look at building a community, you might experience a specific fear. It\u2019s common with new hosts. The fear is, \u201cWhat if nobody shows up?\u201d Or (maybe worse), \u201cWhat if they show up and don\u2019t like it?\u201d\nLet\u2019s talk about it.\nWe host 12,000 communities on Mighty Networks. Here are the most common reasons communities fail:\nThey don\u2019t follow the principles of Community Design\u2122. Communities fail when they have no clear Big Purpose or Ideal Member. Letting everyone in and throwing content spaghetti against the wall is a surefire way to fail. Get clear on one person you can help and bring them together.\nThey don\u2019t connect people to each other. If it wasn\u2019t clear from what we said above, you need to connect people to each other for a community to thrive.\nThey drown people with content. \u201cWelcome to our community. Here are the 47 hours of past course content and webinars you can consume.\u201d Who the heck wants to do this? Communities don\u2019t thrive from content alone. They thrive on connections and transformations.\nThey are struggling with tech debt. Mixing platforms, payment gateways, hacking together software. The more places your members have to go, the more they have to remember, the more likely your community is to fail.\nThey quit too soon. We can all get excited about 6-figure launches, but often a great community takes time. If you\u2019ve done everything right, good things still take time to grow. Keep at it. Small communities can be amazing. And thriving communities can grow out of 5 founding members.\nHaving a platform with video options gives you a lot to work with for building engagement. Obviously, you don\u2019t need all community content to be video. Text discussions, images, and even audio have a place. But video has some unique engagement power nothing else has:\nMighty Networks offers livestreaming on every plan. Hosts can launch a livestream, and with Mighty Pro, Space Hosts and moderators can also create and run a stream.\nHere are some of the features of a livestream on a Mighty Network:\nMighty Networks is an all-in-one community platform. This means you can run community, courses, events, and livestreams in one place, and collect payments for any of these in different currencies. Many of the other platforms on this list have limitations on what features they offer\u2013it\u2019s important to read the description carefully.\nOnline communities and social media work on similar concepts. Both use digital features for social networking and content creation. But online communities are basically gated social networks, members need to join. Because of this, online communities can sell membership access as well as other digital products like courses, coaching, or paid events. Or, some online communities remain free to join and offer digital products and experiences as upsells.\nHere are a few of the main benefits of online communities when compared to social media:\nAlways make sure you understand your platform\u2019s data privacy policies. Most community platforms offer a certain security because members are in an enclosed (password protected) ecosystem. But you should understand how each platform uses members' data. You can read Mighty Networks\u2019 data policies here.\nStart a free 14-day trial to explore Mighty\u2014no credit card required.\nTelegram vs. Discord\nWhat Is a Virtual Community?

Small communities can be amazing. And thriving communities can grow out of 5 founding members.\nEmotional connection: We\u2019re hardwired to read people\u2019s faces as we communicate. So adding a face and voice to content can create powerful connections and trust. This translates into better community engagement.\n\nEasier to digest: We hate to admit it, but reading can create cognitive load. When our brains are tired, we\u2019re less likely to read something. Video is easier to process\u2013which is why most social platforms are prioritizing video, especially short-form video.\n\nAuthenticity: It\u2019s an extension of the emotions, but video can boost authenticity.\n\nHigher retention: Social platforms know video works. Video has higher watch-through rates and viewers retain more from video than readers from text. The same principle applies in your community.\n\nSpontaneity: A livestreaming feature adds spontaneity and surprise to your video engagement. It\u2019s intimate and instant, and a livestream can feel the closest thing to actually being in a room with your favorite creator.\nCan go live spontaneously (without creating an event) or with an event.\n\nStream to your entire network or specific spaces for up to 2 hours.\n\nUp to 9 people can join onscreen (including the host).\n\nStreaming is 720p as standard quality or 1080p with Mighty Pro.\n\nStreams across web, Android, and iOS apps.\n\nHigh-velocity live chat (downloadable) and auto-recording.\n\nVoice isolation, visual effects, and screen sharing.\nOnline communities offer more control for hosts. You own your brand, member lists, and have a much higher control over the content members see.\n\nYou can earn more. Social platforms take your content for free and monetize it, sometimes giving you a bit of cash for the advertising space they sell. Online communities make you the owner, and you can choose how you distribute your content.\n\nYou retain copyright. Different social media platforms have different copyright policies, but all of them will take some form of ownership of your content. This could include monetizing it with ads or training AI on it. In an online community, you keep the control.\n\nYou can\u2019t be booted. Social media platforms ban people for a ton of different reasons, many of them lame. An online community that you own means you aren\u2019t at the whims of a social giant.\n\nThere\u2019s no algorithm. On a social media platform, you\u2019re lucky if you get content seen. In a community, you own the distribution and it\u2019s direct to members. If you post it, members see it. (And you can often message them all).\n\nYou can collect member data. On a social media platform, there\u2019s no way to\u2013let\u2019s say\u2013download your followers email addresses. In an online community, this is simple.\nMighty Networks: G2's top-ranked community platform with powerhouse features, AI engagement, and options to sell memberships, courses, events, or bundles.

The best feature is a \u201cleaderboard,\u201d which shows who has engaged the most and gives members a ranking based on their engagement.\nUnlike Mighty Networks, Skool\u2019s community features aren\u2019t in line with a modern community platform. It\u2019s a clunky discussion forum, with a running post list a bit like a Facebook Group.\nAssessment & planning: Figure out what you\u2019re offering, what your current platform sucks at, and where you\u2019re losing engagement. Choose a new community platform and start the planning for the move.\n\nSetup: Start your build on a new platform, preparing for members. This might mean branding, adding existing material (ie. a flagship course), registering a domain, or adding Spaces. If you\u2019re building with a white-label solution, you\u2019ll work with a team to create apps, etc.\n\nStart prepping members: Use email and your existing platform to announce the move and communicate the steps you\u2019ll take. You might opt for a \u201csoft launch\u201d with a handful of supermembers to kick the tires on the new community space.\n\nLaunch: Launch on your new platform, inviting existing members to a kick-off event.\n\nClean-up the old platform: Reach out to any members who haven\u2019t made the jump to a new platform yet. Set a date for deprecating the old platform.\n\nClose and re-direct: Close your old community permanently. If possible, set up a redirect to your new platform; this is helpful for visitors, but it also allows search engines to send your members to the right place. If this is not possible, create a landing page directing old members to the new community.\nMighty Networks: G2's top-ranked community platform with powerhouse features, AI engagement, and options to sell memberships, courses, events, or bundles.

It\u2019s a clunky discussion forum, with a running post list a bit like a Facebook Group.\nThe features are ridiculously basic.

Choose a new community platform and start the planning for the move.\nSetup: Start your build on a new platform, preparing for members. This might mean branding, adding existing material (ie. a flagship course), registering a domain, or adding Spaces. If you\u2019re building with a white-label solution, you\u2019ll work with a team to create apps, etc.\nStart prepping members: Use email and your existing platform to announce the move and communicate the steps you\u2019ll take. You might opt for a \u201csoft launch\u201d with a handful of supermembers to kick the tires on the new community space.\nLaunch: Launch on your new platform, inviting existing members to a kick-off event.\nClean-up the old platform: Reach out to any members who haven\u2019t made the jump to a new platform yet. Set a date for deprecating the old platform.\nClose and re-direct: Close your old community permanently. If possible, set up a redirect to your new platform; this is helpful for visitors, but it also allows search engines to send your members to the right place. If this is not possible, create a landing page directing old members to the new community.\nThe Mindful Living Collective: Dr. Elisha Goldstein\u2019s mindfulness community offering 6,000+ members courses, meditation, and premium groups. It hit the limit on the course platform Ruzuku because there was no way to keep engagement going after the courses ended.\nJourney of Intrinsic Health: An 8-week health transformation program with community, coaching and events. It migrated from Facebook Groups mixed with a custom-built LMS.\nMarie Forleo: Marie Forleo built her flagship B-School program with a mix of a custom membership site + a complicated tech stack. She moved the whole thing to Mighty Pro, with a 7-figure launch in 2024.\nZynnyMe: A community for therapists running a private practice, complete with exam prep and training. It was built on a mixture of Facebook Groups and WordPress plugins, and migrated to Mighty Networks.\nMarketing managers who want to move up to VP\nWanna-be scrapbookers learning to freeze memories in time\nFirst-time dads learning how to dad\nRookie yogis learning the practice\nYour members create the content they care about (aka user-generated content) and engage.\nThey ask for what they want and they trust you when you sell. Throw out the high-pressure sales funnel (Did it ever really work?).\nIf you\u2019re charging a membership fee, you\u2019ve got recurring revenue.\nYou create the same stuff whether you\u2019ve got 100 or 10,000 members. It\u2019s scalable.\nAn entrepreneurship org. launched to 5,000 members and made over $30,000 in 2 \u00bd weeks.\nA health-focused community launched to 100 high-ticket members and added $40,000 in ARR.\nAn author & speaker launched a 4-week promotion in their membership community and saw an additional $30,000 in revenue.\nA podcaster and author sold 5,000 seats to a $997 course in 10 days to existing members.\nOne community launched a 13-week add-on course and generated an additional $100k in revenue in 2 months.\nWhen members face friction at checkout or accessing spaces?\nWhen members can\u2019t find things like event links or courses?\nWhen using features isn\u2019t intuitive?\nWhen members can\u2019t access the community on a mobile app?\nThe question is NOT, \u201cDo your hosts create enough content?\u201d\nThe question is, \u201cAre my members making friends?\u201d\nTools to help you know what you have in common with other members\nTools to get your creativity flowing (like member profile prompts or post help)\nTools to start conversations (like discussion prompts)\nThey don\u2019t follow the principles of Community Design\u2122. Communities fail when they have no clear Big Purpose or Ideal Member. Letting everyone in and throwing content spaghetti against the wall is a surefire way to fail. Get clear on one person you can help and bring them together.\nThey don\u2019t connect people to each other. If it wasn\u2019t clear from what we said above, you need to connect people to each other for a community to thrive.\nThey drown people with content. \u201cWelcome to our community. Here are the 47 hours of past course content and webinars you can consume.\u201d Who the heck wants to do this? Communities don\u2019t thrive from content alone. They thrive on connections and transformations.\nThey are struggling with tech debt. Mixing platforms, payment gateways, hacking together software. The more places your members have to go, the more they have to remember, the more likely your community is to fail.\nThey quit too soon. We can all get excited about 6-figure launches, but often a great community takes time. If you\u2019ve done everything right, good things still take time to grow. Keep at it. Small communities can be amazing. And thriving communities can grow out of 5 founding members.\nEmotional connection: We\u2019re hardwired to read people\u2019s faces as we communicate. So adding a face and voice to content can create powerful connections and trust. This translates into better community engagement.\nEasier to digest: We hate to admit it, but reading can create cognitive load. When our brains are tired, we\u2019re less likely to read something. Video is easier to process\u2013which is why most social platforms are prioritizing video, especially short-form video.\nAuthenticity: It\u2019s an extension of the emotions, but video can boost authenticity.\nHigher retention: Social platforms know video works. Video has higher watch-through rates and viewers retain more from video than readers from text. The same principle applies in your community.\nSpontaneity: A livestreaming feature adds spontaneity and surprise to your video engagement. It\u2019s intimate and instant, and a livestream can feel the closest thing to actually being in a room with your favorite creator.\nCan go live spontaneously (without creating an event) or with an event.\nStream to your entire network or specific spaces for up to 2 hours.\nUp to 9 people can join onscreen (including the host).\nStreaming is 720p as standard quality or 1080p with Mighty Pro.\nStreams across web, Android, and iOS apps.\nHigh-velocity live chat (downloadable) and auto-recording.\nVoice isolation, visual effects, and screen sharing.\nOnline communities offer more control for hosts. You own your brand, member lists, and have a much higher control over the content members see.\nYou can earn more. Social platforms take your content for free and monetize it, sometimes giving you a bit of cash for the advertising space they sell. Online communities make you the owner, and you can choose how you distribute your content.\nYou retain copyright. Different social media platforms have different copyright policies, but all of them will take some form of ownership of your content. This could include monetizing it with ads or training AI on it. In an online community, you keep the control.\nYou can\u2019t be booted. Social media platforms ban people for a ton of different reasons, many of them lame. An online community that you own means you aren\u2019t at the whims of a social giant.\nThere\u2019s no algorithm. On a social media platform, you\u2019re lucky if you get content seen. In a community, you own the distribution and it\u2019s direct to members. If you post it, members see it. (And you can often message them all).\nYou can collect member data. On a social media platform, there\u2019s no way to\u2013let\u2019s say\u2013download your followers email addresses. In an online community, this is simple.\nAI engagement\nTry it free\nFind out more here\n1. Mighty Networks\n2. Mighty Pro\nLearn more\n3. Discord\n4. Geneva\n5. Hivebrite\n6.

For example, Discord is a great (and free) platform that\u2019s \u201cjust for fun,\u201d but you wouldn\u2019t build a digital business there.\nTo help you narrow down your options, we\u2019ve broken down the three types of online community software that people look for:\nenterprise\n(software that helps you build a community made up of customers or clients),\ndigital business\n(to create community, and sell memberships and products you create), and\npersonal\n(for making connections based on shared interests). Which of these descriptions apply to you?\nCustomization, branded apps, member management, community engine\nCustomization, branded apps, member management, community engine\nBuild brand loyalty, boost engagement, get data\nBuild brand loyalty, boost engagement, get data\nBuilding a brand community\nBuilding a brand community\nMemberships, courses, events, & payments\nMemberships, courses, events, & payments\nCreate a digital business\nCreate a digital business\nBuilding a digital business\nBuilding a digital business\nFree community platform, easy access\nFree community platform, easy access\nConnect people with similar interests\nConnect people with similar interests\nConnecting people for fun\nConnecting people for fun\nWhich of these descriptions apply to you?\nPro tip: Give yourself room to grow. If your small business takes off and you need to expand, start with a platform like Mighty that grows with you. You don't want to have to\nmigrate a community\nif you don't need to.\nWhat should you look for in an online community platform?\nContent options (e.g. discussion posts, polls, surveys, and Q&As).\nA community thrives on content that your members create. The easier it is to create what they want to, the better this will be.\nOrganization.\nFlexible\nSpaces\nor subgroups. Not every member wants the same thing. Spaces let you organize people and content (ex. A course Space vs an event Space).\nAccessibility.\nAccessible on web, iOS, and Android apps. People can\u2019t always run to a PC to log on. (\u201cMobile friendly web apps\u201d don\u2019t cut it).\nBranded apps\n(under YOUR brand on iOS and Android).\nEstablished brands and businesses should consider branded community apps (that\u2019s YOUR app in the App Store and Google Play Store).\nAI & Automations\n: Look for an\nAI community platform\n\u2014software that puts your growth on auto-pilot by using automations and AI to deliver better results in less time!\nCourse platforms.\nIf you have something to teach, make sure your community platform can host a live and/or pre-recorded course.\nLivestreaming\nand\nlive events\n.\nMonetization.\nMultiple ways to monetize through events, paid memberships, subscriptions, and\nonline courses\n.\nCommunity analytics & reporting.\nGet detailed member profiles about engagement and what is\u2014and isn\u2019t\u2014working within your community.\nIntegrations and Embeds\nfor connecting to third-party tools (e.g., Zapier, Stripe, ConvertKit). No software does everything, so your community platform should easily integrate with the other relevant software you need.\n20 Top community platforms ranked\nWhat are the best community platforms?

Learn more below.\n3. Discord\nBest free community platform\nDiscord\nis a community platform that\u2019s built for gamers, but hosts all kinds of free communities. It's got 150 million users. For its powerhouse features, plus its cool design and intuitive UX, Discord is the best free community platform on the market.\nDiscord has a community forum-type engine that supports different kinds of content, stickers, emojis, video, and more. But you can also livestream (+ screen share) and live chat.\nDiscord\nis perfect for free communities.\nBut it\u2019s not made for paid communities.\nDiscord did recently create a paid subscription offer, but it's limited to American users right now. It takes a 10% cut of your revenue and isn\u2019t robust enough to create a real\ncommunity business\n. You can't really personalize Discord either.\nDiscord features\nPros\nFree community forum engine with chat options\nGood for streaming\nPopular among gamers\nCons\nLimited community features\nAlmost no way to build a real community business (+ Discord takes 10% of anything you do earn)\nNo branding options (here\u2019s why\nbranding a community\nis important)\nPricing\nFree\n4. Geneva\nBest free video chat platform\nGeneva\nis a community platform and\nchat app\nwith chat rooms, forums, video, and audio-only rooms. It\u2019s great for hosting different kinds of video-based conversations. Geneva comes with an events calendar and\nvirtual events\n(including RSVPs), application forms, moderation features, and the option to add admins. And it has DMs included for 1:1 conversations.\nGeneva has decent membership controls: admin roles and applications. And it has post rooms for content creators (although there are better\ncontent creator platforms\n).\nGeneva is free, which is great! But it\u2019s missing monetization features\u2013so it\u2019s not good for a\npaid community\nof any kind.\nAnd, while Geneva\u2019s video chat features are cool and it\u2019s good for organizing small groups, Geneva is not great for running large communities. And it\u2019s bad at introducing people who don\u2019t already know each other.\nGeneva knows this. And they\u2019ve doubled down on being the online hub for local, IRL communities. And they just got acquired by Bumble, so stay tuned to see where Geneva goes in the future.\nGeneva features\nPros\nChat features with video, audio, and different rooms\nVirtual events hosting & traditional blog posts\nIt\u2019s free\nGood apps for every device\nCons\nCan\u2019t be monetized\nMinimal member-management features\nNot good for a large community\nPricing\nFree\n5. Hivebrite\nBuilt for Alumni Management\nHivebrite\nis a community platform built specifically for\nalumni networks\n, although it can be used for other things. It includes a content management system to organize and publish content, dedicated subgroups where students and alumni can connect, a branded mobile app, and a job board feature.\nHivebrite also comes with a built-in event management system for in-person events, including calendars, invitation emails, ticketing, online payments, and integration with social networks. Finally, it can also run donor campaigns.\nThe downside to Hivebrite is that it\u2019s missing a virtual event feature, which means that if you want to get your alumni together for virtual meetings, coffee hours, or training sessions, you\u2019d need to pair it with a different event or\nvirtual event app\n.\nAnd the community platform feels pretty dated; it\u2019s really just a simple forum.\nHivebrite features\nPros\nAlumni networking app with dedicated subgroups\nCMS + Custom feeds\nLive event management, ticketing, schedules\nJob board, data and analytics\nBranded apps\nCons\nCommunity-building features are extremely basic\nNo livestreaming, video, or courses\nVery limited virtual event features\nPricing\nStarts from $8,000 yr.\n6. Higher Logic Vanilla\nBest Corporate Forum-Only Platform\nHigher Logic Vanilla\nis an online community platform for adding customer communities to corporate websites. It can be customized, and it has\ncommunity management features\n. Members can publish content, create groups and subgroups, and add questions and polls.\nWhile Vanilla Forums offers companies a chance to\nbuild customer support and engagement\n, access to a knowledge base, and useful integrations, it is only a forum feature. It doesn\u2019t have options to sell memberships, subscriptions, or online courses. So, if you\u2019re looking for\na community that you can monetize\n, this isn\u2019t the right choice for you.\nIt\u2019s the best fit for companies looking to add a free, branded forum to a website.\nHigher Logic Vanilla features\nPros\nCorporate forum solution\nSome customization features, reporting, and gamification\nModeration tools + integration with business apps like Salesforce and Zendesk\nCons\nNo real features other than a forum (e.g. no courses or payments)\nLimited subscription tools\nNo apps or white-label apps\nPricing\nEst $9,000 - $150,000/year\n7. Disciple\nEnterprise Branded Apps\nDisciple\nis an\nenterprise community software\nwith a community platform, and things like an activity feed, discussion forums, Q&As, and content creation\u2013text, videos, and images.\nLike others on this list, Disciple has\nmember management tools\n, analytics, and even a built-in email feature. And it can be used to monetize with subscriptions or gated content (i.e. restricting content or access based on membership level).\nFinally, a Disciple community can be deployed on a branded mobile app. The app has features the website doesn\u2019t have, including livestreaming.\nUnfortunately, the app and the online community platform have different features and UX, so it's not a unified experience.\nDisciple features\nPros\nOnline community forum with good content options\nSell subscriptions or gated content\nBranded mobile apps\nCons\nDifferent UX between the online platform and the app\nOutdated community features and feel\nPricing increases the more members you have\nPricing\nPrices start from \u00a338/mo for the first 100 members (web only), \u00a3499/mo to include a mobile app (and up to 500 members), and \u00a3833/mo for a white-label mobile app. And virtually every feature is an add-on.\n8. Kajabi\nBest for Course Creators + Minimal Community Functions\nKajabi\nis well-known among course creators as a place to host an asynchronous course. It has an excellent course platform and marketing toolkit to sell courses with things like landing pages, email campaigns, and triggers.\nIn previous years, they weren\u2019t on this list because of the lack of community options. But with many course creators wanting course communities, Kajabi recently bought a company called Vibely to improve this feature.\nThe result is \"Community 2.0.,\" which moves Kajabi beyond a simple forum and adds a livestreaming feature and meet-ups. The new community feature is an improvement, but it\u2019s still awkward for UX--especially\ncompared to alternatives\n. You need a separate login to access your community\u2013making it impossible to integrate well with a course. And if you wanted to teach a live course on Community 2.0, the LMS isn\u2019t integrated.\nIt ends up feeling a bit like 2 separate products, which is basically what it is.\nKajabi features\nPros\nExcellent asynchronous course LMS with drip content, evaluation options, and customization features\nIntegrated email marketing, landing pages, and other sales tools\nSome new AI features for course creation, landing page copy, and scripts\nCommunity 2.0 adds livestreaming and video conferencing features\nCons\nCommunity 2.0 needs a separate login, doesn\u2019t connect to the LMS, and still has limited community functions.\nOne of the most expensive options on this list.\nNo branded apps, which many successful communities need.\nPricing\nThe basic plan is $149/mo for 3 products, the growth plan is $199/mo with up to 15 products. The pro plan is $399/mo with 100 products.\n9. Bettermode\nThe Forum Platform for Corporations\nBettermode (formerly\nTribe\n) is another\nwhite-label community platform\nfor adding community spaces on brand websites. Its forum tool gives brands a place to create discussions, post content, and reach customers on a mobile app. The content options are flexible, you can add blogs, Q&As, and videos.\nOn Bettermode, customers can connect by asking questions, participating in polls, and posting images and videos. And these members can create profiles and you can assign member roles.\nYou won\u2019t get access to standard community features like connecting members by location or common interests, and more. There\u2019s no way to create and host online courses or live events, which limits how you can connect members.\nThis means Bettermode is best for a certain kind of community: a customer community on a corporate website.\nBettermode Features\nPros\nForum-based community with an explore function\nOrganize conversations with \u201cspaces\u201d\nCustom domain & website builder\nWhite-label app options\nCons\nLimited community functions\nNo courses or live events\nPricing\nStarts from $599/mo with custom enterprise pricing\n10. Circle\nCircle\nis a community platform with features like discussion forums, livestreaming and events, and different ways to create content. It also has member profiles that let your members showcase themselves and find like-minded people.\nCircle lets you create memberships and bundles, giving you a way to monetize your community. You can create spaces and dedicate them to either discussions, chat, courses, or events.\nThe downside to Circle is that you can\u2019t put multiple things in the same space,\nin contrast to Mighty Networks\n. You can\u2019t chat in an event space. You can\u2019t have a discussion in a course space. This segmentation can hurt engagement.\nWith additional costs to add many extras (things like admins, spaces, etc), it\u2019s a more costly option than an all-in-one like Mighty Networks.\nMany of Circle\u2019s features are also\nreally\nearly in development, with apps and courses added last year. They\u2019re still working the bugs out and it\u2019s hard to say how these features will fare long-term.\nCircle features\nPros\nCreate discussions, chat, events, and course spaces\nMonetize memberships with subscriptions or bundles\nCons\nOnly one feature per space. Courses can\u2019t be mixed with events, with chat, etc.\nThere are limits on seats for admins, members, spaces, etc. with additional costs to add more\nPricing\nPricing starts from $89/mo for the community features, $199/mo to add workflows and customizations, and $499/mo for an enterprise plan with all features, dedicated services, and priority support.\n11. Facebook Groups\nLet\u2019s talk\nFacebook Groups\n. Since Facebook has a huge user base, and it's free and easy to\nbuild a group\n, some people host communities there.\nIt might be a good place to start.\nAs far as free online communities built on social media platforms go, Facebook groups work okay.\nFor larger communities or paid membership communities,\nFacebook is probably not the right place to host though\n.\nThere's no payment integrations.\nIt doesn't do well for large groups.\nYou'll fight the algorithms.\nPlus, some people are hesitant to put their data on Facebook.\nBut if you\u2019re just starting out, or want a really simple and free community option, it can work.\nFacebook Groups features\nPros\nFree & easy to use\nGood apps that integrate with a Facebook account\nWell-known and popular\nCons\nIt\u2019s a constant fight with the algorithm\nNo monetization options\nYou pay to reach your members\nNo real branding options\nPricing\nFree\n12. Slack\nSlack\nis a platform a lot of people know. Built for the workplace, it helps teams organize work.\nIt\u2019s got channel and messaging features and basic member profiles\u2013meaning it can host discussions. With mentions, different content features, and \u201chuddles\u201d for quick calls, it does have some of the features that make online communities work.\nBut, while you can\nbuild a community on Slack\n, in the big picture,\nit isn\u2019t great for online communities\n. It\u2019s got limited member roles and limited content types, and it lacks the types of features to build out a full community business (events, courses, content gating, etc.) Slack is also missing monetization, so you can\u2019t start a paid community on it.\nIt\u2019s basically\nlike Discord\n. Most Hosts outgrow it OR find that their community fails from lack of\nengagement options\n. Let\u2019s not forget that Slack works for the virtual office because people HAVE to be there.\nSlack features\nPros\nGood chat & messaging features (it replaced email for the office)\nOrganize conversations, tag relevant people\nMix 1:1 chat and group conversations.\nCons\nNo monetization\nMissing features for a vibrant community (content, courses, events, etc.)\nNo personalization\nPricing\nFrom $8.75/mo per user up to enterprise-level pricing\n13. Wild Apricot\nThe Community Platform for Nonprofits\nWild Apricot\nis a community management platform created for nonprofit organizations. It has community engagement and discussion tools. But it's really made to manage members in an organization or association.\nWith Wild Apricot, you can create, organize and manage your member databases, use the platform\u2019s website builder to create a professional-looking website, securely accept online payments, and manage virtual events. Plus, you can create subgroups for regional chapters, so that each can have its own website and community.\nThis software works great as a\nnonprofit membership platform\n. It's not great for paid, robust communities. And the design and UX is very dated.\nWild Apricot features\nPros\nForum platform & website builder\nMember databases\nRegional chapters & subgroups\nLive event functionality for ticketing\nBranding options\nCons\nDated look and user experience\nLimited community features (courses, gated content, etc. missing)\nNo branded apps (despite being an enterprise solution)\nPricing\nFrom $60-$900/mo\n14. Discourse\nBest Open-source Community Platform\nDiscourse\nis a community software with an open-source community code that they post for free on GitHub. Discourse gives you a discussion forum that\u2019s simple, but effective. You can organize conversations and replies, and add moderators.\nThe downside to Discourse is that you do need to pay for hosting somewhere. Discourse will do it for you, but it ends up starting from $50/mo, which is more expensive than several of the community platforms on this list.\nBasically, Discourse is an okay forum engine if you\u2019re a developer, but otherwise, you\u2019re better to go with an all-in-one that\u2019s done for you (and potentially cheaper).\nDiscourse Features\nPros\nForum with comments and moderation\nCustom code that\u2019s open-source\nCons\nExtremely dated feel and user experience\nNo community features other than a forum\nRequires development\nPricing\nFrom $50/mo\n15. Memberium\nBest WordPress Community Platform\nIf you\u2019re a diehard\nWordPress\nfan and looking for a community platform that\u2019s a WordPress plugin, you could look at\nMemberium\n. It works like a content gate, barring off sections of your site to make them members only, and includes a community component. You can also pair it with an LMS plugin like\nLearnDash\nif you want to add a course.\nMemberium features\nPros\nWordPress plugin\nGated content and member-areas\nForum features\nCons\nVery basic and dated user experience\nLikely requires development to customize\nNo apps\nPricing\nFrom $37 or $57/mo depending on your CRM.\n16. Memberful\nMemberful\nis another WordPress option. It\u2019s a plugin that turns your WordPress website into a basic membership platform, opening up the option to charge for a community. Memberful\nis not a community platform\n, however, but can be used to gate other community platforms like Discord and charge for access. It can also sell\ndigital goods\n\u2013including online courses\u2013and even physical goods. And there are sales options like coupons, discounts, and promotions.\nAlthough you don\u2019t technically need WordPress to start a community with Memberful, it\u2019s weak as an all-around community platform. It\u2019s best as a plugin.\nMemberful features\nPros\nMembership plugin for adding content gates to WordPress.\nSell memberships, courses, physical, and\ndigital products\n.\nCons\nYou would need to mix platforms together to get the functions of a good community.platform (and it still won\u2019t work as well).\nPricing\n$49/mo + 4.9% transaction fees\n17. BuddyBoss\nBuddyBoss\nis the last WordPress plugin we\u2019ll list here. It comes with the tools you need to add community dashboards, profiles, posts, comments, and messaging. And you can even add events, job boards, or an online store. If you want to add a course to this offering, you\u2019d need another plugin like\nLearnDash\n.\nBuddyBoss features\nPros\nWordPress community plugin with gated content\nGood community features like discussions, profiles, chat & messaging\nOptions to add a white-label app\nCons\nWordPress plugins are often glitchy, and you need multiple plugins to get all the features\nThe app is really basic\nPricing\nWeb theme only from $299/yr. Adding an app starts from $179/mo\n18. Skool\nSkool\nis a new forum platform created by Sam Ovens. Recently, influencer Alex Hormozi has been heavily involved selling the platform too--he's part owner.\nSkool is really a community-style social media platform\u2013and people usually love it or hate it. It features really basic forums that feel something like reddit\u2013conversations you can join and respond to. There are also user profiles and a live event feature.\nThere are two things about Skool that seem to resonate with the people who like it.\nThe \u201cdiscoverability\u201d - Skool lets people search for and\nfind communities\nin the way\nSubstack\nlets people find\nnewsletters\n, and that may help people get found.\nThe \u201c\ngamification\n\u201d - Skool has marketed its gamification features hard, and they may be useful to some communities. The best feature is a \u201cleaderboard,\u201d which shows who has engaged the most and gives members a ranking based on their engagement.\nHowever, Skool has a lot of weak points which push it down this list.\nUnlike Mighty Networks\n, Skool\u2019s community features aren\u2019t in line with a modern community platform. It\u2019s a clunky discussion forum, with a running post list a bit like a Facebook Group.\nThe features are ridiculously basic. You can schedule an event, but you need to host on a different platform. You can \u201cCreate a course\u201d in the settings tab. But the \u201ccourse\u201d is only a series of gated posts.\nThere\u2019s almost no way to add your brand to anything.\nSkool encourages its Hosts to sign up other Hosts to the platform\u2013if someone gets you to join Skool through an affiliate link they earn 40% of your membership fees.\nSkool features\nPros\nDiscoverable, simple discussion forums\nLeaderboards\nCons\nExtremely basic UX\nAlmost no native features\nIt\u2019s still more expensive than full community platforms\nPrice\n$99/mo + transaction fees\n19. Telegram\nTelegram\nis something in between a community platform and social media, although it\u2019s better for broadcasting than turning strangers into friends. It does mix chat functions and email with the option to send files, voice, and video messages.\nThe main community feature Telegram has is its Channels: themed groups people can join. The admin(s) can broadcast up to 200,000 people.\nYou can monetize a Telegram channel with paid subscriptions\u2013although you need an integration to do it. And Telegram has good apps for all devices.\nTelegram doesn\u2019t let you build an interactive community where members can get to know each other. It\u2019s built for top-down broadcasting and messaging.\nTelegram features\nPros\nSMS and chat app\nBroadcast features for reaching thousands of people at once\nCan be monetized (with an integration)\nCons\nIt doesn\u2019t have the features of a proper community platform. It\u2019s built for top-down communication.\nPrice\nFree\n20. LearnWorlds\nWe\u2019ll round out this list with\nLearnWorlds\n\u2013a great course platform with a basic community platform attached. LearnWorlds is a SCORM-compliant course platform with a website-builder attached. It also has some useful marketing tools, things like customer sales funnels, email, and affiliate programs.\nLearnWorlds has a good mobile app and you can livestream a course too.\nThe community functions as a generic discussion forum, and you can create Spaces for individual courses. For course businesses with multiple teachers and admins, the instructors can follow the discussions in their course Spaces without seeing the whole community. It's really basic as a community platform\ncompared to its alternatives\n, but good as a course platform.\nLearnWorlds features\nPros\nGood SCORM-compliant LMS that can create courses and websites\nIntegrated marketing tools for emails, funnels, and sales\nCons\nThe community features are extremely basic\nPrice\nBasic version from $24/mo, but most features are on more expensive plans\nWhich community platform is right for you?

That\u2019s okay! Because moving a community is easier than it\u2019s ever been!\nCreators migrate for a lot of reasons, but most common are low engagement, missing key features (like apps or courses), struggles to use a platform, and cost.\nIf you\u2019re migrating, here\u2019s a sample roadmap:\nAssessment & planning:\nFigure out what you\u2019re offering, what your current platform sucks at, and where you\u2019re losing engagement. Choose a new community platform and start the planning for the move.\nSetup:\nStart your build on a new platform, preparing for members. This might mean branding, adding existing material (ie. a flagship course), registering a domain, or adding Spaces. If you\u2019re building with a white-label solution, you\u2019ll work with a team to create apps, etc.\nStart prepping members:\nUse email and your existing platform to announce the move and communicate the steps you\u2019ll take. You might opt for a \u201csoft launch\u201d with a handful of supermembers to kick the tires on the new community space.\nLaunch:\nLaunch on your new platform, inviting existing members to a kick-off event.\nClean-up the old platform:\nReach out to any members who haven\u2019t made the jump to a new platform yet. Set a date for deprecating the old platform.\nClose and re-direct:\nClose your old community permanently. If possible, set up a redirect to your new platform; this is helpful for visitors, but it also allows search engines to send your members to the right place. If this is not possible, create a landing page directing old members to the new community.\nIf you\u2019re interested in migrating to Mighty, we have this form you can fill out to match you with the right plan and features.\nMove to Mighty\nMigration success stories\nThe Mindful Living Collective\n: Dr. Elisha Goldstein\u2019s mindfulness community offering 6,000+ members courses, meditation, and premium groups.

That\u2019s what an online community does at its best.\nAnd at a time when\n1 in 4 people\nsay they are \"very lonely,\" community is a human necessity.\nBut there's more.\nThe best communities often go through a transformation together.\nWhether it\u2019s the\u2026\nMarketing managers who want to move up to VP\nWanna-be scrapbookers learning to freeze memories in time\nFirst-time dads learning how to dad\nRookie yogis learning the practice\nThe transformation journey is what makes communities work.\nThat\u2019s why we use something called a Big Purpose as a\nmission statement\nfor your community.

And we\u2019ve learned something about what it takes to turn a community into a 6-, 7- and even 8-figure digital business.\nIn fact, the greatest opportunity in the world is staring brands in the face. Your competitors probably aren\u2019t doing it.\nBrands that give people a place to belong have the ultimate competitive edge.\nAnd that\u2019s why online communities are so powerful.

Throw out the high-pressure sales funnel (Did it ever really work?).\nIf you\u2019re\ncharging a membership fee\n, you\u2019ve got recurring revenue.\nYou create the same stuff whether you\u2019ve got 100 or 10,000 members.

It's a business model like no other.\nHere are some examples from Mighty:\nAn entrepreneurship org. launched to 5,000 members and made over $30,000 in 2 \u00bd weeks.\nA health-focused community launched to 100 high-ticket members and added $40,000 in ARR.\nAn author & speaker launched a 4-week promotion in their membership community and saw an additional $30,000 in revenue.\nA podcaster and author sold 5,000 seats to a $997 course in 10 days to existing members.\nOne community launched a 13-week add-on course and generated an additional $100k in revenue in 2 months.\nThe platform is your secret weapon\nWhat role does community software play in creating spaces to belong? In creating businesses?\nThe single platform is where the magic happens. It\u2019s the operations. The tech stack.\nYour members engage with your platform every time they come on. In a perfect world, they don\u2019t think about the tech. And they definitely shouldn't fight with it. They just start connecting and creating.\nWhat happens when the community software gets in the way?\nWhen members face friction at checkout or accessing spaces?\nWhen members can\u2019t find things like event links or courses?\nWhen using features isn\u2019t intuitive?\nWhen members can\u2019t access the community on a mobile app?\nBest-case scenario, you end up with frustrated users. Worst-case scenario, you end up with churn and angry ex-members.\nNobody wants that.\nThat\u2019s why\nthe platform you choose\nreally does matter.\nWhat about communities and AI?\nSince AI is the word on everyone\u2019s mind, how does AI fit in with community software? Not everyone has adopted it yet, but here's how we\u2019re using it.\nWe didn't just want AI to create more content. We asked, \"How can AI help us build better communities?\"\nAnd we started with one data point.\nWe can predict with 93% accuracy whether a community will succeed or fail. Communities succeed when members connect or collaborate with each other.\nThe question is NOT, \u201cDo your hosts create enough content?\u201d\nThe question is, \u201cAre my members making friends?\u201d\nCommunities don\u2019t just thrive because people show up. They thrive because people meet each other.\nSo we harnessed AI to make those meetings better\u2026\nTools to help you know what you have in common with other members\nTools to get your creativity flowing (like member profile prompts or post help)\nTools to start conversations (like discussion prompts)\nAnd we automated the community-building process so that Mighty Co-Host\u2122 can get a community up and running in minutes.\nMighty\u2019s CEO, Gina Bianchini,\nwrote an article about this on LinkedIn\nif you want to read more!\nWhy communities fail\nAs you look at building a community, you might experience a specific fear. It\u2019s common with new hosts. The fear is, \u201cWhat if nobody shows up?\u201d Or (maybe worse), \u201cWhat if they show up and don\u2019t like it?\u201d\nLet\u2019s talk about it.\nWe host 12,000 communities on Mighty Networks. Here are the most common reasons communities fail:\nThey don\u2019t follow the principles of\nCommunity Design\u2122.\nCommunities fail when they have no clear\nBig Purpose\nor\nIdeal Member\n. Letting everyone in and throwing content spaghetti against the wall is a surefire way to fail. Get clear on one person you can help and bring them together.\nThey don\u2019t connect people to each other.\nIf it wasn\u2019t clear from what we said above, you need to connect people to each other for a community to thrive.\nThey drown people with content.\n\u201cWelcome to our community. Here are the 47 hours of past course content and webinars you can consume.\u201d Who the heck wants to do this? Communities don\u2019t thrive from content alone. They thrive on connections and transformations.\nThey are struggling with tech debt.\nMixing platforms, payment gateways, hacking together software. The more places your members have to go, the more they have to remember, the more likely your community is to fail.\nThey quit too soon.\nWe can all get excited about 6-figure launches, but often a great community takes time. If you\u2019ve done everything right, good things still take time to grow. Keep at it. Small communities can be amazing. And\nthriving communities\ncan grow out of 5 founding members.\nWhy does video matter for community platform engagement?\nHaving a platform with video options gives you a lot to work with for building engagement. Obviously, you don\u2019t need all community content to be video.\nText discussions, images, and even audio have a place. But video has some unique engagement power nothing else has:\nEmotional connection: We\u2019re hardwired to read people\u2019s faces as we communicate. So adding a face and voice to content can create powerful connections and trust. This translates into better community engagement.\nEasier to digest: We hate to admit it, but reading can create cognitive load. When our brains are tired, we\u2019re less likely to read something. Video is easier to process\u2013which is why most social platforms are prioritizing video, especially\nshort-form\nvideo.\nAuthenticity:\nIt\u2019s an extension of the emotions, but video can boost authenticity.\nHigher retention: Social platforms know video works. Video has higher watch-through rates and viewers\nretain more from video\nthan readers from text. The same principle applies in your community.\nSpontaneity\n: A livestreaming feature adds spontaneity and surprise to your video engagement. It\u2019s intimate and instant, and a livestream can feel the closest thing to actually being in a room with your favorite creator.\nWhich community platform is best for live streaming?\nMighty Networks offers livestreaming on every plan. Hosts can launch a livestream, and with Mighty Pro, Space Hosts and moderators can also create and run a stream.\nHere are some of the features of a livestream on a Mighty Network:\nCan go live spontaneously (without creating an event) or with an event.\nStream to your entire network or specific spaces for up to 2 hours.\nUp to 9 people can join onscreen (including the host).\nStreaming is 720p as standard quality or 1080p with Mighty Pro.\nStreams across web, Android, and iOS apps.\nHigh-velocity live chat (downloadable) and auto-recording.\nVoice isolation, visual effects, and screen sharing.\nWhich community platform is all-in-one?\nMighty Networks is an all-in-one community platform. This means you can run community, courses, events, and livestreams in one place, and collect payments for any of these in different currencies. Many of the other platforms on this list have limitations on what features they offer\u2013it\u2019s important to read the description carefully.\nHow do online communities differ from social media?\nOnline communities and social media work on similar concepts. Both use digital features for social networking and content creation. But online communities are basically gated social networks, members need to join. Because of this, online communities can sell membership access as well as other digital products like courses, coaching, or paid events. Or, some online communities remain free to join and offer digital products and experiences as upsells.\nHere are a few of the main benefits of online communities when compared to social media:\nOnline communities offer more control for hosts. You own your brand, member lists, and have a much higher control over the content members see.\nYou can earn more. Social platforms take your content for free and monetize it, sometimes giving you a bit of cash for the advertising space they sell. Online communities make\nyou the owner, and you can choose how you distribute your content.\nYou retain copyright. Different social media platforms have different copyright policies, but all of them will take some form of ownership of your content. This could include monetizing it with ads or training AI on it. In an online community, you keep the control.\nYou can\u2019t be booted. Social media platforms ban people for a ton of different reasons, many of them lame. An online community that you own means you aren\u2019t at the whims of a social giant.\nThere\u2019s no algorithm. On a social media platform, you\u2019re lucky if you get content seen. In a community, you own the distribution and it\u2019s direct to members. If you post it, members see it. (And you can often message them all).\nYou can collect member data. On a social media platform, there\u2019s no way to\u2013let\u2019s say\u2013download your followers email addresses. In an online community, this is simple.\nHow do I ensure platform security and data privacy?\nAlways make sure you understand your platform\u2019s data privacy policies. Most community platforms offer a certain security because members are in an enclosed (password protected) ecosystem. But you should understand how each platform uses members' data.

But they have their sheer load of limitations.\nSlack feels more like a corporate collaboration tool and wasn\u2019t designed for community-driven learning. Facebook is riddled with distractions. Neither platform offered the control I needed to run a serious business around my community.\nSo, I\u2019m done with these platforms. SIMPLY DONE.\nSecondly, reading about features isn\u2019t enough. I needed to know how these platforms perform when building an actual community. What\u2019s the setup experience like? How effective are their features in practice? What\u2019s the member experience look like?\nConsider this the ultimate guide to choosing the best community platforms where I\u2019ll show you where each tool measures up especially when it comes to:\nLet\u2019s get started.\nAny platform that supports threaded discussions in an online space can count as a community building platform.\nSo what did I consider when evaluating the best tools?\nTo help you understand this better, let me start with why I needed a community platform in the first place.\nI run a coaching program called Fractional Lab\u2014where I help freelancers, consultants and service providers build profitable, lean fractional businesses.\nI didn\u2019t want to start yet another Slack group collecting dust. I wanted a setup where teaching felt organized, participation felt natural, and the community pulled each other up.\nThat meant the platform had to do a few things really well:\nSuper straightforward, right?\nNow, here\u2019s what my selection process was like.\nI started by making a list of 30 popular and top rated online community software.\nAnd right away, I began cutting down my list.\nFirst, I wanted to focus on community software platforms that:\nThat said, I eliminated platforms that:\nWhile they\u2019re good starting places, it\u2019s hard to build a professional community on them.\nThey don\u2019t have native ways to monetize your groups. You also have limited control over branding, ownership and members\u2019 engagement and data.\nTo put it simply,\nI didn\u2019t want to build my community in a place I had nearly no control.\nSo\u2026 Reddit, FB Groups, and Discord were out.\nThese came down to two things.\nFirst, pricing.\nI didn\u2019t want to pay nearly 500 bucks for community software.\nFor example, Disciple\u2019s cheapest plan starts at $729/month (if you choose to pay annual) for upto 500 members.\nAnd it lets you even have a branded community mobile app.\nBut that\u2019s still expensive.\nOthers like Disco, Zapnito, and GlueUp hide their pricing behind a \u201cBook demo\u201d button. Which doesn\u2019t give you an idea on what to expect in terms of pricing.\nSecond, many of these enterprise community management software have a reputation of being clunky and a nightmare to work with.\nHere\u2019s what few users on Reddit had to say about one of them.\nIn that case, Disciple Media, Disco, Zapnito, Discourse, GlueUp, Higher Logic, SocialPlus, Hivebrite, Khoros, MembersClicks, and WildApricot were also outta my list.\nI have used WordPress to know enough. And honestly, it\u2019s the last place I\u2019d want to host my community.\nIt has so many moving parts.\nYou need to:\nThese are the things I didn\u2019t want to deal with.\nIt\u2019s an expensive venture in the long run. Money-wise, and time-wise.\nNot to mention if you\u2019re new to WordPress, you\u2019ll quickly realize that it\u2019s not the most user-friendly and secure CMS and website builder.\nThat said, I eliminated MemberPress, BuddyBoss, AccessAlly, and LearnDash.\nAs I had mentioned earlier on, Slack lacks any native way to host a paid community.\nYes, it\u2019s free for unlimited members. Yes, there are workarounds to paywall your group via a third party like LaunchPass.\nBut there are some huge risks that made me not consider it.\nFirst, the Slack free plan limits your message history for upto 90 days. Meaning you and your members can\u2019t access conversations older than 90 days. So if you have some good information buried down in your chats that your members might need, I\u2019m sorry but after 90 days you have to kiss it goodbye.\nSuppose you decide to go for its paid plan. Well, it\u2019s prohibitively expensive.\nMost successful communities I know have around 500 members. Slack\u2019s Pro plan costs $8.75 per member per month, which translates to $4,375 per month for a 500-member community. That\u2019s a steep price unless you\u2019re running a paid community\u2014something I would never recommend doing on Slack.\nSo Slack was also off my list.\nDuring my tests, I came across a few platforms that almost checked everything I was looking for.\n(Podia, LearnWorlds, Thinkific and Patreon.)\nAnd I almost considered them.\nUntil I tested each one of them.\nPodia checks the basics and could work if you just need a simple digital business setup. But it felt unpolished. The interface looks dated, templates are basic, and the entire community feature feels tacked on as an afterthought rather than a core part of the experience.\nLearnWorlds and Thinkific didn\u2019t fare much better. Both are strong if you only want to build courses. But offered a barebones community building experience.\nFor Patreon \u2014 this was the last place I wanted to build an online learning community. Patreon is more of a membership site platform for creators. It screams \u201chelp a broke creator out\u201d and I didn\u2019t want to send the same message to my audience.\nStill, I tested it. And right away, I hit limitations. The only way to run an event is by livestreaming through Vimeo, YouTube Live, or Crowdcast. There\u2019s no option to schedule events nativel, host interactive workshops or private calls using Zoom, Google Meet, or any video tool you actually control.\nBranding is another wall. Patreon offers minimal customization. You can\u2019t whitelabel your community or use your own domain. Your membership always sits under the Patreon brand.\nThen there are the fees. Patreon takes 8% to 12% of every transaction. The platform is free to join, but as your revenue grows, so does the cut they take. Over time, those transaction fees can add up fast and eat into your profits.\nIn that case,  LeanWorlds, Podia and Patreon were also out.\nNow that I had narrowed down my list to 7:\nIt was time to actually test them in detail to see where each thrives and lacks.\nSo, buckle up.\nAfter testing more than a dozen community platforms\u2014including Skool, Bettermode, and Disco\u2014Circle offered the strongest balance between pricing, functionality and user experience.\nIt has a clean and modern interface yet refreshingly easy to use. Its features are extensive without being overwhelming. Pricing is reasonable given what\u2019s included.\nMany platforms I tried struggled to strike this balance.\nFor example, Bettermode is flexible and highly customizable but has a steeper learning curve for beginners. Skool is simple to set up but feels barebones. And Disco is robust but expensive.\nIn Circle, you can organize your community using spaces and space groups.Think of spaces as channels in Slack, but with more flexibility.\nEach space can serve as a course hub, event room, discussion forum, chat room, or multimedia library.\nYou can control access by setting any space as public, private, or secret depending on what you want members to see or join.\nSpace Groups let you cluster related spaces under a common theme or topic which makes it for easier navigation.\nI liked how modular and intentional Circle community organizational structure was. Because given this flexiblity you can design a community structure that fits your needs. From course communities, cohort-based learning programs, mastermind groups, to customer support forums.\nBelow are the features that stood out to me.\nCircle isn\u2019t the most affordable online community platform. But considering all the feature set that it comes packed with, it\u2019s easy to see why it charges a premium pricing.\nAll its plans support unlimited members, but the number of spaces, admins, and moderators varies by tier.\nBelow is a simple price breakdown of Circle\u2019s pricing.\nPros\nCons\nCircle offers well-rounded community-building features while also keeping user experience in mind. It\u2019s the best community platform for building dedicated online spaces to offer exclusive content such as online courses, coaching, and digital downloads. It\u2019s also ideal for building engaging communities using discussions, gamification and live events.\n\ud83d\udc49 Explore Circle.so free for 14 days.\nAlso read:\nMighty Networks is the best solution if you want more flexibility in structuring your community, impressive engagement tools and the ability to create multi-level experience in your network.\nUnlike most community platforms\u2014such as Circle\u2014that only let you have courses, discussions, and memberships into distinct spaces, Mighty Networks gives you the flexibility to combine them into one.\nFor example, you can create course space and include engagement capabilities like discussions, chats, and events without creating separate spaces for each.\nThis can come in handy especially if you plan to offer cohort-based courses where social and collaborative learning thrives.\nYou can gate access to individual spaces or bundle multiple spaces into a Collection where you can control access.\nThe platform also integrates with Stripe, allowing you to charge for memberships, courses, or one-time purchases directly within the community. If you prefer external payment processing, you can connect tools like ThriveCart through Zapier.\nMost platforms offer basic group segmentation, but Mighty Networks takes it further with automated workflows. You can set rules that automatically invite members to new spaces on course completion, engagement levels, or subscription status ensuring that the community scales efficiently without manual admin work.\nSpeaking of community engagement, Mighty Networks has various interactive tools to keep your community active. You can create community posts, articles and add media content such as images, videos, and GIFs. You can also go live inside a space, start polls, or run quizzes.\nUnlike Circle and Skool, Mighty Networks doesn\u2019t have a dedicated leaderboard system that you can use to gamify your community engagement. Although there are workarounds on that it would be better if it had a dedicated tool for that.\nHowever, Mighty Networks makes up for this with more impressive gamification capabilities such as streaks, milestones, challenges, habit tracker, badges and ambassador program.\nMighty Networks offers one of the most affordable pricing packages in the market. Its pricing package \u201cCommunity\u201d start as low as $33 per month.\nThis is way below compared to its competitors like Kajabi or Thinkfic. However, the downside of this plan is that it doesn\u2019t include an online course builder, or quizzes and has limited analytics.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of Mighty Networks\u2019 pricing structure.\nMighty Networks is the best platform for building custom, highly engaging social communities. It seamlessly integrates community features with online courses and memberships, allowing you to create a sustainable business while keeping members engaged. You can build branded communities that align with your theme, engage members through events, chats, posts, polls, leaderboards, and quizzes.\n\ud83d\udc49 Explore Mighty Networks free for 14 days.\nAlso read:\nBettermode gives you more branding control and design flexibility. It\u2019s the best platform if you\u2019re building product communities, branded creator spaces or enterprise networks.\nUpon signing up, you\u2019ll get access to 30+ community templates covering various use cases like learning communities, developer hubs, customer support forums,  job boards, and more\u2014so you can launch faster without starting from scratch.\nNone of the community platforms I tested, not even Circle, Mighty Networks, or Kajabi offered extensive design templates as Bettermode.\nYou can customize your community by adding your logo, choosing custom fonts, setting your own color palette, and hosting it on your custom domain. You can even redesign the layout and fully white-label your community end to end.\nI especially liked its Block builder which lets you design custom space layouts.\nInstead of using the predefined space layout you can style the space header, then drag in different block types like accordions, leaderboards, tag filters, HTML scripts, space collections, post feeds, and more.\nFor example, you can use Blocks to build a structured content library\u2014grouping your posts by tag, embedding a video playlist, or showing only pinned posts in a clean card layout.\nHowever this level of control also comes with some tradeoffs. Bettermode has a steep learning curve. Because of its sheer number of customization options, it can take you more time configuring your ideal setup which can be daunting if you\u2019re not familiar with community tools.\nIt\u2019s also not built for education-first communities because it lacks a native course builder. While you can still use Spaces to organize learning materials, it\u2019s not as intuitive using well-rounded online course platforms like Kajabi or Thinkific, which offer built-in tools for curriculum structuring, progress tracking, and assessments.\nMoreover, Bettermode doesn\u2019t support native payments. And from what I saw in their support forums, they aren\u2019t planning to launch them anytime soon.\nIf you want to charge for access to your community via membership or sell content, you\u2019ll need to set it up through third-party tools like Stripe using Zapier. Which, as you can guess already, is daunting for non-technical users.\nUnlike most community platforms I tested, Bettermode is surprisingly affordable. It offers a free plan, a flat-rate Pro plan, and a customizable Enterprise option.\nPros\nCons\nExplore Bettermode\nHeartbeat is a strong choice if you\u2019re building an online learning community and want to integrate course delivery directly into the platform.\nUnlike platforms like Circle, Mighty, or Skool that focus more on community-first experiences, Heartbeat has more compelling online learning features. It offers built-in tools to run both evergreen (self-paced) and cohort-based courses, with progression tracking.\nYou can natively host course videos or embed them from platforms like Wistia, Loom, Vimeo, or YouTube. You can attach assignments, link community discussions to specific lessons, and sync event channels with your courses which lets you cultivate a social learning experience.\nHeartbeat also supports basic automation which simplifies your community management.For example, you can trigger a workflow that sends an email with a certificate download link once a student completes a course.\nOn the community side, Heartbeat supports threaded posts, group chat, events, and voice rooms. You can share videos, write text posts, run polls, and attach files inside posts. Members can RSVP to events, and you can charge for events or make them public. However, it doesn\u2019t support native livestreaming and you\u2019ll need to use Zoom or external video conferencing software of your choice.\nUnlike Circle and Kajabi Communities, Heartbeat doesn\u2019t offer built-in community gamification tools. So if leaderboards, exclusive perks and custom badges are things you\u2019re looking to implement in your community, you\u2019ll want to look elsewhere.\nHeartbeat is reasonably priced, especially compared to platforms like Circle and Mighty Networks. Its plans are clearly structured, outlining what you get and where limits apply.\nThe Starter plan costs $49/month and includes core features like courses, events, and workflows. But it limits your community to 1,000 members and doesn\u2019t include advanced options like API access or email white-labeling.\nThe Growth plan, at $129/month, removes those limits. You get unlimited members, access to the API, email white-labeling, and priority support.\nFor larger communities, Heartbeat offers a Business plan with custom pricing. It includes everything in Growth, plus a fully white-labeled mobile app and dedicated support from the Heartbeat team.\nHowever, Heartbeat\u2019s trascational fees are slightly higher than its counterparts like Circle and Kajabi.\nPros\nCons\nExplore Heartbeat Community for 14-days for free\nKajabi is the best online community platform if you\u2019re looking for a comprehensive digital business solution that comes with well-intergrated sales and marketing features.\nUnlike community-focused platforms like Circle and Mighty Networks, Kajabi provides everything you need to run your business in one place. You can build websites, create sales funnels, run email marketing campaigns, and set up checkout systems\u2014without relying on third-party tools.\nFor example, you won\u2019t need Kit for email marketing or ClickFunnels for sales funnels because Kajabi has these features built in.\nLike Heartbeat, Kajabi Community is refreshingly easy to use. You can structure and organize your community using Channels and Access Groups which makes it easy to manage content and member interactions.\nChannels serve as the main organization tool within your community. They allow you to structure your community around different topics or themes, which can take various forms, such as group chats or threaded discussions.\nI found creating posts straightforward, though I felt like its post editor could need more polishing because it looked a bit dated. But it lets you create everything from simple community text posts, to long articles. You can also embed multimedia like images, videos, audio files, and even polls to increase engagement.\nApart from creating posts, Kajabi also lets you engage members via challenges, leaderboards and meetups.\nUnlike other platforms such as Circle, Mighty Networks, or Heartbeat, Kajabi provides native tools for hosting challenges directly in your community.\nYou can set one-time or recurring challenges, set their duration, and even specify rewards for winners.\nSpeaking of leaderboards, Kajabi lets you award members points when they complete a challenge, RSVP to an event, respond to a poll and more.\nYou can customize the points system, award badges, and even assign titles to members who reach certain milestones.\nKajabi also supports live events, allowing you to host virtual gatherings for up to 200 attendees within specific channels or access groups. Members can RSVP, and you can use the platform\u2019s built-in livestreaming feature.\nI actually did try its livestreaming tool and I liked it. It\u2019s simple with decent web conferencing tools and settings. ( please don\u2019t roast my low res laptop webcam)\nDuring live events, you can share your screen, enable chat, and even create breakout rooms, making it easy to host interactive sessions. You can also record your sessions which can make good learning materials.\nIn my opinion, Kajabi is the best solutionif you\u2019re looking to build an engaging online learning space for your courses and coaching programs, without the need to pay for separate tools for marketing and sales.\nThe Kajabi online community builder is well polished. It has an intuitive UI and strong engagement features. You can create Circles to organize your community and manage access with Access Groups. You can then engage members using community posts, polls, challenges, live events and gamification.\nKajabi comes at a higher price tag compared to other specialized online community platforms due to its comprehensive approach\nHere\u2019s a brief breakdown of Kajabi Pricing.\nPros\nCons\n\ud83d\udc49 Explore Kajabi free for 30 days.\nAlso read: Kajabi alternatives\nSwarm works a little differently than many other online community platforms I\u2019ve tested on this list.\nInstead of centering on courses, discussions, or gamification, it focuses more on offering a video-based community experience.\nThis can come in handy if you rely on video to connect with your audience.\nFor example if you\u2019re a YouTuber sharing behind the scenes content or online coach offering interactive workshops.\nIn Swarm, your community will be structured and organized using Hubs. They\u2019re similar to Circle\u2019s spaces or Channels in slack. A Hub can either be video, or discussion, or chat focused.\nWithin your community hubs, you can choose to share content by recording a video or audio on the go right within the Swarm platform or you can upload video files from your local storage.\nYou can also embed your videos from external hosting platforms like YouTube, Wistia and Vimeo.\nSwarm also lets you create text based community posts with rich content such as images,GIFs, audio, polls and file attachments.\nSpeaking of events, Swarm lets you natively stream your live sessions or you can choose to use a third party software like Zoom or Webinarjam. However, its native live events features come with serious limitations of 1 hour max for its high end plan and even 2 minutes (yes you\u2019ve read that right) for its cheapest plan.\nCompared to most platforms I\u2019ve reviewed on this list, Swarm is slightly expensive. It places strict limits on the number of spaces (which function like groups), members, and live stream duration. However, if you need more flexibility and unrestricted access, upgrading to the Elite plan removes these limits and includes a branded community app.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of Swarm\u2019s pricing:\nSwarm is the best community platform if you\u2019re looking to build an online space where video is the primary form of engagement. It\u2019s useful especially for coaches and educators looking to build tightly focused communities where they can offer value to their clients either in small groups or 1-on-1 sessions.\n\ud83d\udc49 Explore Swarm free for 14 days.\nSkool offers a simple, minimalistic platform ideal for beginners and digital business owners who need a powerful yet straightforward tool for building online communities and selling online courses. It avoids the complexity of traditional LMS tools, an all-in-one community platforms making it easier to manage and use.\nWith Skool, you can create online courses and lock content based on members\u2019 levels, encouraging participation and engagement.\nThere\u2019s no limit to the number of courses you can add, and you can drip-schedule your lessons to improve student engagement and knowledge retention.\nYou can gamify your community via leaderboards and use polls to boost member interaction.\nYou also offer value using community posts, videos, and GIFs to engage members further.\nWhile Skool allows you to create events within your community, it lacks native video live-streaming features available in platforms like Circle and Mighty Networks \u2014 relying instead on third-party integrations.\nSkool provides cost-effective, transparent pricing. For $99 per month, you gain access to unlimited course creation for an unlimited number of students. This plan includes all features, such as email broadcasts, chat, and community metrics, ensuring a complete solution without unexpected fees.\nSkool is one of the best online community software for creators who want to offer a community experience for their students. It allows you to gamify course content via leaderboards, and boost community engagement using posts, events, discussions, and chats. Skool is also easy to use making it a no-brainer even for first-timers to build their first community and offer value via courses and coaching.\nAlso read: Skool Review\n\ud83d\udc49 Create a free Slack account.\nLook for key features such as discussion forums, live chat, member directories, event management, content sharing, live events, integrations, and monetization options.\nPlatforms like Circle, Mighty Networks, and Skool provide strong engagement tools such as interactive discussions, live streaming, polls, direct messaging, and gamification. Others like Kajabi lets you create challenges and Swarm has the best video community engagement experience.\nYes. Discord, Slack, Reddit, Facebook Groups, and Telegram allow you to build and manage communities for free. However, they come with limitations like lack of ownership, monetization capabilities and  limited customization.\nMighty Networks, Circle, GroupApp and Kajabi offer built-in monetization tools, allowing you to sell memberships, courses, and premium content.\nBuilding content programs that lead to meaningful business growth\n\u00a9 2023 - 2025 LinoDash Media.

You can create rich posts and threaded discussions with media embeds and searchable history. Or you  can choose other formats including chat, events, courses and media library. You can choose to set each of your spaces accessible to everyone, private and secret\u2014which makes it easy to set multiple membership access inside your main community.\nPaywalls: Paywalls let you monetize your community natively. You can gate access to either your entire community or individual spaces which is ideal if you\u2019re building a multi-tier membership. You can charge one-time fees, set up recurring subscriptions, or offer installment payments. Circle supports various payment options like Apple Pay, Google Pay, credit/debit cards, and even BNPL options like Affirm, Afterpay, and Klarna. Just note that Paywalls is all powered by Stripe, so it\u2019s only available where Stripe is supported.\nAccess groups: It\u2019s a pre-configured bundle of spaces and space groups that make it easier to control which spaces members get access to when they join your community. Instead of manually assigning space access for each invite, paywall, or sign-up flow, you can link that entry point to an access group. You can create multiple access groups for different membership tiers, cohorts, or program types. When someone joins using a specific invite or paywall, they\u2019re instantly placed in the right spaces based on the group you\u2019ve connected. You can even combine multiple access groups during onboarding if needed.\nSolid events management: You can schedule events, send reminders, and let members RSVP. Circle also lets you natively host live rooms (up to 150 people) and livestreams (up to 2,000) replacing the need for third party web conferencing tools like Zoom. You can also record sessions for reuse in your courses.\nOnline courses: Circle lets you create structured courses with drip scheduling capabilities. You can natively host your course materials but if you have your video recordings hosted elsewhere like on Wistia, Vimeo and YouTube, you can quickly embed them into your course curriculum via a link embed. I\u2019ve tried a  ton of course platforms like Kajabi and Thinkific and they\u2019re a pain when it comes to embedding video lessons hosted on third-party platforms. However, Circle isn\u2019t the best solution if you\u2019re looking to build sophisticated learning programs. It falls flat when it comes to student assessment since it only supports quizzes. It doesn\u2019t support exams, gradebooks and  course completion certificate issuing so if you\u2019re running upskill and certification programs you\u2019d want to go with a more dedidated platform like Thinkific or LearnWorlds.\nRobust community post editor: Circle offers one of the most capable post editors I\u2019ve used on any community platform. You can write long-form posts with rich formatting like subheadings (up to H3), bullet lists, blockquotes, and buttons. It also supports a wide range of media including images, video embeds, PDFs, and interactive elements from third-party tools like Typeform and Airtable. I tested several of Circle\u2019s competitors, and very few came close in terms of editorial flexibility and publishing tools.\nCustomization and branding: Circle\u2019s UI is easy to brand. You can customize the color palette, modify the top nav bar, add your logo, connect your own domain and also white-label notification emails. If you want to go even further, Circle\u2019s Plus plan lets you build a fully branded mobile app for your community.\nWorkflows: Workflows is Circle\u2019s built-in automation tool. It lets you automate repetitive tasks like sending welcome messages to new members or granting access to specific paywalled spaces. You can also use it to create basic automated email sequences which is useful if you\u2019re not using an external email marketing platform. The only downside is that Workflows are only available on the Business plan and above. They\u2019re not included in the lower-tier Professional plan.\nMarketing hub: This is essentially Circle\u2019s email marketing tool. It\u2019s not included in Circle\u2019s subscriptions and instead it\u2019s available as an add-on. You can use it to send email broadcasts, set up basic automations based on member activity, and create opt-in forms for list building. However, I found its email template designer and form builder fairly basic. \nAI agents: Only available on Circle\u2019s Enterprise and Custom plans, AI Agents let you automate support and engagement at scale. You can train agents using your community\u2019s content including posts, courses, comments, and custom data. These agents can then answer questions, onboard new members, and handle billing or technical issues. \nGamification: Circle includes native gamification features like leaderboards and point-based rewards system. Members can earn points for actions like getting likes or comments, and level up over time. You can customize point thresholds, levels, and use workflows to reward members with badges, exclusive access, personalized thank-you notes, or even discounts on premium offers. \nSegments: As your community scales, targeting the right members becomes harder. Segments simplify this by letting you create dynamic audience groups based on filters like roles, tags, and other attributes. You can use segments to filter your audience list, trigger workflows, send targeted email broadcasts, or push notifications on branded apps. \nAffiliates: With Circle, you can create an affiliate program to allow members earn a commission for referring other people to your paid community boosting your digital business growth.\nProfessional \u2013 $99/month: up to 3 admins, 10 moderators, 20 spaces\nBusiness \u2013 $219/month: up to 5 admins, 15 moderators, 30 spaces\nEnterprise \u2013 $499/month: up to 10 admins, 100 moderators, 100 spaces\nPlus \u2013 Custom pricing: up to 20 admins, 200 moderators, 500 spaces\nClean, intuitive interface for both members and admins\nModular structure with flexible space types\nRobust post editor with rich formatting and media support\nStrong community management tools via segments, workflows, moderation, and access groups\nNative tools for live streaming\nAI agents for support and engagement\nNative course builder\nCommunity white-labelling\nMobile apps for iOS and Android\nTransactional fees\nLimited built-in marketing tools (basic page builder, email marketing requires add-on)\nHard limits on spaces, admins, and moderators per plan\nExpensive addons\nCircle.so review\nCircle vs. Mighty Networks\nCircle.so tutorial\nBest For: Creators, Non-profits, and Online Coaches.\nPrice: $49 \u2013 $430per month\nMobile App: Yes (Android & iOS)\nActivity Feed: This feature provides real-time updates, keeping members informed about new posts, events, and discussions. It also features advanced filters to allow members to customize their feed to show only relevant updates. For example, they can use the \u201cPersonal Feed\u201d to view activity from specific spaces they belong to.\nCustomizable Member Profiles: Members can personalize their profiles to showcase their interests and expertise. Members can also view other members\u2019 information such as the spaces they belong to, badges earned, followers, and connections within the network. This feature fosters deeper relationships by providing insights into each member\u2019s background, encouraging meaningful interactions.\nResource Library: A centralized hub where you can organize and share valuable content, such as guides, PDFs, videos, or articles. It helps community members easily access key resources, ensuring they find the information they need without searching multiple places.\nOnline Courses: Mighty Networks allows you to create and manage online courses directly on the platform. This feature is ideal for community leaders looking to monetize their expertise or engage members through community-driven learning.\nLive Events: You can host and manage virtual events, webinars, or meetings within the platform. This encourages real-time engagement and offers opportunities for networking, learning, and discussing important community topics.\nAmbassador Program: It\u2019s a referral system inside the platform that allows you to reward members for inviting others to join the community.\nThe Community Plan starts at $49/month\nThe Courses Plan: starts at $119/month\nThe Business Plan: starts at $219/month\nThe Path-to-Pro Plan: costs $430/month\nMighty Pro: contact their sales team to get custom pricing\nCircle vs Mighty Networks review\nMighty Networks review\nBest for: startups, saas businesses and enterprise communities.\nPrice: free \u2013 $59 per month\nMobile apps: no\nStrong community moderation tools: Bettermode includes built-in AI-powered moderation. You can enable Akismet and OOPSpam to automatically detect spam based on IP address, user agent, referrer, and site URL. You can also set keyword-based triggers to flag sensitive content for manual review. As the admin you can place specific members on a watchlist, meaning their posts and comments would require approval before being visible.\nMessaging: Members can message each other directly or participate in private group chats\u2014all within the platform. Messaging is native and doesn\u2019t require external tools.\nEvents hosting: You can create, schedule, and manage events directly on Bettermode platform. Members can RSVP, add events to their calendars, and receive reminders.\nMulti-language support: You can localize the interface based on your audience. Members will see translated UI elements like menus, buttons, and prompts according to their language preferences. \nDetailed Reporting: You can access analytics on posts, comments, membership growth, engagement, moderation actions, and messaging which lets you measure community health and identify trends.\nBlocks: Instead of a fixed layout, Bettermode gives you drag-and-drop control over how each Space looks and functions. You can build a clean video library using post feeds and tag filters, create a multi-section help center with accordions and post blocks, or design a custom homepage using space collections, leaderboards, and HTML embeds. \nCMS models: Bettermode lets you define exactly what kind of content lives in each Space. You can create structured models for things like knowledge base articles, job listings, documentation, or tutorials. Each model is made up of custom fields like titles, tags, dropdowns, file uploads, embeds, and more. This means you get to decide what content fields appear, how they\u2019re displayed, and who can publish or edit them. Perfect for building searchable, structured hubs inside your community.\nAPI and webhooks: Bettermode lets you intergrate your community with the rest of your tools using API and webhooks. You can use the API to sync members, pull content, or publish updates from other platforms. Meanwhile webhooks let you trigger workflows like sending a Slack alert when someone posts in a feedback Space, or enrolling new members in your email list when they join a private group.\nStarter:free for upto 100 members and 20 spaces.\nPro: $59/month for unlimited members, 20 spaces, and 20 CMS collections\nEnterprise: custom pricing with tailored limits, advanced support, and security features\nFree plan available\nAdvanced branding and design customization\nRobust moderation tools\n20+ prebuilt community templates\nRich profile fields and customizable properties\nPowerful analytics and reporting\nGamification via leaderboards and custom badgesr\nCommunity white-labelling\nSteep learning curve\nNo built-in payment tools\nLimited marketing tools\nBest for: online coaches, trainers, educators and course creators\nPrice: $49 \u2013 $129 per month\nMobile app: yes (iOS and Android)\nCourse creation tools: with Heartbeat you can create self-paced and cohort-based course programs. You can natively host your course materials, assess your learners with assigments and track their progress. However, it lacks diverse assessment tols like exams, multiple choice quizzes, survey forms, peer review and course completion certifcate. But for simple learning and coaching programs, Heartbeat thrives in that.\nEvents management: the platform lets you host events inside your community with RSVP, reminders, and calendar integration. You can control who sees and joins your events by setting your events as paid and public. However unlike Circle and Mighty Networks it doesn\u2019t support in-platform livestreaming and requires external tools like Zoom.\nAutomation & workflows: you can build simple automations which simplify community management.You get access to 10+ workflow templates covering various useases like events management, members onboarding and payment processing. For example you can create a workflow that\u2019s triggered when new members join your community and are automatically to a specific access group.\nBuilt-in payment processing: with Heartbeat you can charge access to your courses, community, and events. It features payment processing tools powered by Stripe gateway. You can set up one-time, recurring and even tiered payments options for your community.

It also supports a wide range of media including images, video embeds, PDFs, and interactive elements from third-party tools like Typeform and Airtable. I tested several of Circle\u2019s competitors, and very few came close in terms of editorial flexibility and publishing tools.\nCustomization and branding: Circle\u2019s UI is easy to brand. You can customize the color palette, modify the top nav bar, add your logo, connect your own domain and also white-label notification emails. If you want to go even further, Circle\u2019s Plus plan lets you build a fully branded mobile app for your community.\nWorkflows: Workflows is Circle\u2019s built-in automation tool. It lets you automate repetitive tasks like sending welcome messages to new members or granting access to specific paywalled spaces. You can also use it to create basic automated email sequences which is useful if you\u2019re not using an external email marketing platform. The only downside is that Workflows are only available on the Business plan and above. They\u2019re not included in the lower-tier Professional plan.\nMarketing hub: This is essentially Circle\u2019s email marketing tool. It\u2019s not included in Circle\u2019s subscriptions and instead it\u2019s available as an add-on. You can use it to send email broadcasts, set up basic automations based on member activity, and create opt-in forms for list building. However, I found its email template designer and form builder fairly basic.\nAI agents: Only available on Circle\u2019s Enterprise and Custom plans, AI Agents let you automate support and engagement at scale. You can train agents using your community\u2019s content including posts, courses, comments, and custom data. These agents can then answer questions, onboard new members, and handle billing or technical issues.\nGamification: Circle includes native gamification features like leaderboards and point-based rewards system. Members can earn points for actions like getting likes or comments, and level up over time. You can customize point thresholds, levels, and use workflows to reward members with badges, exclusive access, personalized thank-you notes, or even discounts on premium offers.\nSegments: As your community scales, targeting the right members becomes harder. Segments simplify this by letting you create dynamic audience groups based on filters like roles, tags, and other attributes. You can use segments to filter your audience list, trigger workflows, send targeted email broadcasts, or push notifications on branded apps.\nAffiliates: With Circle, you can create an affiliate program to allow members earn a commission for referring other people to your paid community boosting your digital business growth.\nProfessional \u2013 $99/month: up to 3 admins, 10 moderators, 20 spaces\nBusiness \u2013 $219/month: up to 5 admins, 15 moderators, 30 spaces\nEnterprise \u2013 $499/month: up to 10 admins, 100 moderators, 100 spaces\nPlus \u2013 Custom pricing: up to 20 admins, 200 moderators, 500 spaces\nClean, intuitive interface for both members and admins\nModular structure with flexible space types\nRobust post editor with rich formatting and media support\nStrong community management tools via segments, workflows, moderation, and access groups\nNative tools for live streaming\nAI agents for support and engagement\nNative course builder\nCommunity white-labelling\nMobile apps for iOS and Android\nTransactional fees\nLimited built-in marketing tools (basic page builder, email marketing requires add-on)\nHard limits on spaces, admins, and moderators per plan\nExpensive addons\nCircle.so review\nCircle vs. Mighty Networks\nCircle.so tutorial\nBest For: Creators, Non-profits, and Online Coaches.\nPrice: $49 \u2013 $430per month\nMobile App: Yes (Android & iOS)\nActivity Feed: This feature provides real-time updates, keeping members informed about new posts, events, and discussions.

Members can also view other members\u2019 information such as the spaces they belong to, badges earned, followers, and connections within the network. This feature fosters deeper relationships by providing insights into each member\u2019s background, encouraging meaningful interactions.\nResource Library: A centralized hub where you can organize and share valuable content, such as guides, PDFs, videos, or articles. It helps community members easily access key resources, ensuring they find the information they need without searching multiple places.\nOnline Courses: Mighty Networks allows you to create and manage online courses directly on the platform. This feature is ideal for community leaders looking to monetize their expertise or engage members through community-driven learning.\nLive Events: You can host and manage virtual events, webinars, or meetings within the platform. This encourages real-time engagement and offers opportunities for networking, learning, and discussing important community topics.\nAmbassador Program: It\u2019s a referral system inside the platform that allows you to reward members for inviting others to join the community.\nThe Community Plan starts at $49/month\nThe Courses Plan: starts at $119/month\nThe Business Plan: starts at $219/month\nThe Path-to-Pro Plan: costs $430/month\nMighty Pro: contact their sales team to get custom pricing\nCircle vs Mighty Networks review\nMighty Networks review\nBest for: startups, saas businesses and enterprise communities.\nPrice: free \u2013 $59 per month\nMobile apps: no\nStrong community moderation tools: Bettermode includes built-in AI-powered moderation. You can enable Akismet and OOPSpam to automatically detect spam based on IP address, user agent, referrer, and site URL. You can also set keyword-based triggers to flag sensitive content for manual review. As the admin you can place specific members on a watchlist, meaning their posts and comments would require approval before being visible.\nMessaging: Members can message each other directly or participate in private group chats\u2014all within the platform.

You can build a clean video library using post feeds and tag filters, create a multi-section help center with accordions and post blocks, or design a custom homepage using space collections, leaderboards, and HTML embeds.\nCMS models: Bettermode lets you define exactly what kind of content lives in each Space. You can create structured models for things like knowledge base articles, job listings, documentation, or tutorials. Each model is made up of custom fields like titles, tags, dropdowns, file uploads, embeds, and more. This means you get to decide what content fields appear, how they\u2019re displayed, and who can publish or edit them. Perfect for building searchable, structured hubs inside your community.\nAPI and webhooks: Bettermode lets you intergrate your community with the rest of your tools using API and webhooks. You can use the API to sync members, pull content, or publish updates from other platforms. Meanwhile webhooks let you trigger workflows like sending a Slack alert when someone posts in a feedback Space, or enrolling new members in your email list when they join a private group.\nStarter:free for upto 100 members and 20 spaces.\nPro: $59/month for unlimited members, 20 spaces, and 20 CMS collections\nEnterprise: custom pricing with tailored limits, advanced support, and security features\nFree plan available\nAdvanced branding and design customization\nRobust moderation tools\n20+ prebuilt community templates\nRich profile fields and customizable properties\nPowerful analytics and reporting\nGamification via leaderboards and custom badgesr\nCommunity white-labelling\nSteep learning curve\nNo built-in payment tools\nLimited marketing tools\nBest for: online coaches, trainers, educators and course creators\nPrice: $49 \u2013 $129 per month\nMobile app: yes (iOS and Android)\nCourse creation tools: with Heartbeat you can create self-paced and cohort-based course programs. You can natively host your course materials, assess your learners with assigments and track their progress. However, it lacks diverse assessment tols like exams, multiple choice quizzes, survey forms, peer review and course completion certifcate. But for simple learning and coaching programs, Heartbeat thrives in that.\nEvents management: the platform lets you host events inside your community with RSVP, reminders, and calendar integration. You can control who sees and joins your events by setting your events as paid and public. However unlike Circle and Mighty Networks it doesn\u2019t support in-platform livestreaming and requires external tools like Zoom.\nAutomation & workflows: you can build simple automations which simplify community management.You get access to 10+ workflow templates covering various useases like events management, members onboarding and payment processing.

Some common uses of these systems can be found on E-commerce websites such as eBay, Amazon.com, and Etsy as well as online advice communities such as Stack Exchange.[1] These reputation systems represent a significant trend in \"decision support for Internet mediated service provisions\".[2] With the popularity of online communities for shopping, advice, and exchange of other important information, reputation systems are becoming vitally important to the online experience. The idea of reputation systems is that even if the consumer can't physically try a product or service, or see the person providing information, that they can be confident in the outcome of the exchange through trust built by recommender systems.[2]\nCollaborative filtering, used most commonly in recommender systems, are related to reputation systems in that they both collect ratings from members of a community.[2] The core difference between reputation systems and collaborative filtering is the ways in which they use user feedback. In collaborative filtering, the goal is to find similarities between users in order to recommend products to customers. The role of reputation systems, in contrast, is to gather a collective opinion in order to build trust between users of an online community.\nHoward Rheingold states that online reputation systems are \"computer-based technologies that make it possible to manipulate in new and powerful ways an old and essential human trait\".[3] Rheingold says that these systems arose as a result of the need for Internet users to gain trust in the individuals they transact with online. The trait he notes in human groups is that social functions such as gossip \"keeps us up to date on who to trust, who other people trust, who is important, and who decides who is important\". Internet sites such as eBay and Amazon, he argues, seek to make use of this social trait and are \"built around the contributions of millions of customers, enhanced by reputation systems that police the quality of the content and transactions exchanged through the site\".\nThe emerging sharing economy increases the importance of trust in peer-to-peer marketplaces and services.[4] Users can build up reputation and trust in individual systems but usually don't have the ability to carry those reputations to other systems. Rachel Botsman and Roo Rogers argue in their book What's Mine is Yours (2010),[5] that \"it is only a matter of time before there is some form of network that aggregates reputation capital across multiple forms of Collaborative Consumption\". These systems, often referred to as reputation banks, try to give users a platform to manage their reputation capital across multiple systems.\nThe main function of reputation systems is to build a sense of trust among users of online communities. As with brick and mortar stores, trust and reputation can be built through customer feedback. Paul Resnick from the Association for Computing Machinery describes three properties that are necessary for reputation systems to operate effectively.[2]\nThese three properties are critically important in building reliable reputations, and all revolve around one important element: user feedback. User feedback in reputation systems, whether it be in the form of comments, ratings, or recommendations, is a valuable piece of information. Without user feedback, reputation systems cannot sustain an environment of trust.\nEliciting user feedback can have three related problems.\nOther pitfalls to effective reputation systems described by A. Josang et al. include change of identities and discrimination. Again these ideas tie back to the idea of regulating user actions in order to gain accurate and consistent user feedback. When analyzing different types of reputation systems it is important to look at these specific features in order to determine the effectiveness of each system.\nThe IETF proposed a protocol to exchange reputation data.[6] It was originally aimed at email applications, but it was subsequently developed as a general architecture for a reputation-based service, followed by an email-specific part.[7] However, the workhorse of email reputation remains with DNSxL's, which do not follow that protocol.[8] Those specification don't say how to collect feedback \u2014in fact, the granularity of email sending entities makes it impractical to collect feedback directly from recipients\u2014 but are only concerned with reputation query/response methods.\nHigh reputation capital often confers benefits upon the holder. For example, a wide range of studies have found a positive correlation between seller rating and selling price on eBay,[10] indicating that high reputation can help users obtain more money for their items. High product reviews on online marketplaces can also help drive higher sales volumes.\nAbstract reputation can be used as a kind of resource, to be traded away for short-term gains or built up by investing effort. For example, a company with a good reputation may sell lower-quality products for higher profit until their reputation falls, or they may sell higher-quality products to increase their reputation.[11] Some reputation systems go further, making it explicitly possible to spend reputation within the system to derive a benefit. For example, on the Stack Overflow community, reputation points can be spent on question \"bounties\" to incentivize other users to answer the question.[12]\nEven without an explicit spending mechanism in place, reputation systems often make it easier for users to spend their reputation without harming it excessively. For example, a ridesharing company driver with a high ride acceptance score (a metric often used for driver reputation) may opt to be more selective about his or her clientele, decreasing the driver's acceptance score but improving his or her driving experience. With the explicit feedback provided by the service, drivers can carefully manage their selectivity to avoid being penalized too heavily.\nReputation systems are in general vulnerable to attacks, and many types of attacks are possible.[13] As the reputation system tries to generate an accurate assessment based on various factors including but not limited to unpredictable user size and potential adversarial environments, the attacks and defense mechanisms play an important role in the reputation systems. [14]\nAttack classification of reputation system is based on identifying which system components and design choices are the targets of attacks. While the defense mechanisms are concluded based on existing reputation systems.\nThe capability of the attacker is determined by several characteristics, e.g., the location of the attacker related to the system (insider attacker vs. outsider attacker). An insider is an entity who has legitimate access to the system and can participate according to the system specifications, while an outsider is any unauthorized entity in the system who may or may not be identifiable.\nAs the outsider attack is much more similar to other attacks in a computer system environment, the insider attack gets more focus in the reputation system. Usually, there are some common assumptions: the attackers are motivated either by selfish or malicious intent and the attackers can either work alone or in coalitions.\nAttacks against reputation systems are classified based on the goals and methods of the attacker.\nHere are some strategies to prevent the above attacks.[17]\nDonate\nCreate account\nLog in\nArticle\nTalk\nRead\nEdit\nView history\nSearch: web (see PageRank)\neCommerce: eBay, Epinions, Bizrate, Trustpilot\nSocial news: Reddit, Digg, Imgur\nProgramming communities: Advogato, freelance marketplaces, Stack Overflow\nWikis: Increase contribution quantity and quality[9]\nInternet Security: TrustedSource\nQuestion-and-Answer sites: Quora, Yahoo! Answers, Gutefrage.net, Stack Exchange\nEmail: DNSBL and DNSWL provide global reputation about email senders\nPersonal Reputation: CouchSurfing (for travelers),\nNon Governmental organizations (NGOs): GreatNonProfits.org, GlobalGiving\nProfessional reputation of translators and translation outsourcers: BlueBoard at ProZ.com\nAll purpose reputation system: Yelp, Inc.\nAcademia: general bibliometric measures, e.g. the h-index of a researcher.\nSelf-promoting Attack. The attacker falsely increases their own reputation. A typical example is the so-called Sybil attack where an attacker subverts the reputation system by creating a large number of pseudonymous entities, and using them to gain a disproportionately large influence.[15] A reputation system's vulnerability to a Sybil attack depends on how cheaply Sybils can be generated, the degree to which the reputation system accepts input from entities that do not have a chain of trust linking them to a trusted entity, and whether the reputation system treats all entities identically.\nWhitewashing Attack. The attacker uses some system vulnerability to update their reputation. This attack usually targets the reputation system's formulation that is used to calculate the reputation result. The whitewashing attack can be combined with other types of attacks to make each one more effective.\nSlandering Attack. The attacker reports false data to lower the reputation of the victim nodes. It can be achieved by a single attacker or a coalition of attackers.\nOrchestrated Attack. The attacker orchestrates their efforts and employs several of the above strategies. One famous example of an orchestrated attack is known as an oscillation attack.[16]\nDenial of Service Attack. The attacker prevents the calculation and dissemination of reputation values in reputation systems by using Denial of Service method.\nPreventing Multiple Identities\nMitigating Generation of False Rumors\nMitigating Spreading of False Rumors\nPreventing Short-Term Abuse of the System\nMitigating Denial of Service Attacks\nCollaborative filtering\nCollective influence algorithm\nCommons-based peer production\nDefaulted executee\nGovernment by algorithm\nHonor system\nInfluence-for-hire\nKarma\nOnline participation\nOnline presence management\nReputation capital\nReputation management\nSesame Credit\nSharing economy\nSocial Credit System\nSocial currency\nSocial media optimization\nSocial profiling\nSocial translucence\nSubjective logic\nTrust metric\nWeb of trust\nWhuffie\nDellarocas, C.

If an online community has a large stream of interactions happening, but no feedback is gathered, the environment of trust and reputation cannot be formed.\nThe second of these problems is gaining negative feedback from users. Many factors contribute to users not wanting to give negative feedback, the most prominent being a fear of retaliation. When feedback is not anonymous, many users fear retaliation if negative feedback is given.\nThe final problem related to user feedback is eliciting honest feedback from users. Although there is no concrete method for ensuring the truthfulness of feedback, if a community of honest feedback is established, new users will be more likely to give honest feedback as well.\n^ \"What is reputation?

If an online community has a large stream of interactions happening, but no feedback is gathered, the environment of trust and reputation cannot be formed.\nThe second of these problems is gaining negative feedback from users. Many factors contribute to users not wanting to give negative feedback, the most prominent being a fear of retaliation. When feedback is not anonymous, many users fear retaliation if negative feedback is given.\nThe final problem related to user feedback is eliciting honest feedback from users. Although there is no concrete method for ensuring the truthfulness of feedback, if a community of honest feedback is established, new users will be more likely to give honest feedback as well.\nSearch: web (see PageRank)\neCommerce: eBay, Epinions, Bizrate, Trustpilot\nSocial news: Reddit, Digg, Imgur\nProgramming communities: Advogato, freelance marketplaces, Stack Overflow\nWikis: Increase contribution quantity and quality[9]\nInternet Security: TrustedSource\nQuestion-and-Answer sites: Quora, Yahoo!

The attacker falsely increases their own reputation. A typical example is the so-called Sybil attack where an attacker subverts the reputation system by creating a large number of pseudonymous entities, and using them to gain a disproportionately large influence.[15] A reputation system's vulnerability to a Sybil attack depends on how cheaply Sybils can be generated, the degree to which the reputation system accepts input from entities that do not have a chain of trust linking them to a trusted entity, and whether the reputation system treats all entities identically.\nWhitewashing Attack. The attacker uses some system vulnerability to update their reputation. This attack usually targets the reputation system's formulation that is used to calculate the reputation result. The whitewashing attack can be combined with other types of attacks to make each one more effective.\nSlandering Attack. The attacker reports false data to lower the reputation of the victim nodes. It can be achieved by a single attacker or a coalition of attackers.\nOrchestrated Attack. The attacker orchestrates their efforts and employs several of the above strategies. One famous example of an orchestrated attack is known as an oscillation attack.[16]\nDenial of Service Attack. The attacker prevents the calculation and dissemination of reputation values in reputation systems by using Denial of Service method.\nPreventing Multiple Identities\nMitigating Generation of False Rumors\nMitigating Spreading of False Rumors\nPreventing Short-Term Abuse of the System\nMitigating Denial of Service Attacks\nCollaborative filtering\nCollective influence algorithm\nCommons-based peer production\nDefaulted executee\nGovernment by algorithm\nHonor system\nInfluence-for-hire\nKarma\nOnline participation\nOnline presence management\nReputation capital\nReputation management\nSesame Credit\nSharing economy\nSocial Credit System\nSocial currency\nSocial media optimization\nSocial profiling\nSocial translucence\nSubjective logic\nTrust metric\nWeb of trust\nWhuffie\n^ \"What is reputation?

Now I need to make them feel like heroes.\nRunning a campaign where the PC's time travel, & next session will be the most cliche D&D session.\nAdvice for running intrigue campaign at mid-levels?\nI\u2019m starting a new campaign soon (a highly homebrewed Storm King\u2019s Thunder game) and wanted to add a WoW-like reputation system. Doing quests and gathering desired materials for an organization/city will unlock certain benefits, items etc. with them as well as doing an action that goes against an organization will lower the parties reputation with them. Anyone have any experience with adding something like this to their games? Would love to hear some ideas about this and how to implement it.\nI use a faction reputation system for some of my games that deal with different gangs and organizations.\nThe higher you climb in the guild the more benefits you get.. each affiliation has a different point system. Gang might be based around crime. A mage guild one is based around Knowledge and acquisition of secrets etc..\nMy players loved it\ntrack me\nTried it, abandonded it, without my players even really noting that it was there.\nWhat was the major problem? Video games have quests on the timescale of you can do 3-5 in one session, and many people can play daily if you want. That means a system where odd jobs and quests change the reputations is something the player can meaningfully engineer by investing a day to increase the reputation. When I noted that a similar investment to increase the reputation with a single faction would probably span weeks or more than a month of real time, I ditched it and moved back to hand-waving. (Players become friendly due to interactions and their interactions change politics, but it's not tied to point systems).\nThis is not to say don't do it, but please learn from my mistakes: If you want to do this, then think what exactly would change reputation. It should be something that doesn't replace the normal flow, so odd-jobs should really just take an hour or less, and otherwise the quests should just factor into the reputation system without the players having to stop what they would be doing otherwise. Also small investment should bring large changes. If I need to do three quests for a city before I get benefits those benefits have to be massive. Otherwise, it should be done very quickly.\nBut I fully acknowledge that a) I just was unlucky with my attempt, and b) my players are really not the kind to over-gamify everything, and obviously preferred me just hand-waving this stuff.\nCheck renown in the dmg.\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\nReputation systems in D&D\nr/DnDHomebrew\n\u2022\n4 yr. ago\nReputation systems in D&D\n5 upvotes \u00b7 4 comments\nhow does the reputation system actually work?\nr/Rainbow6\n\u2022\n1 yr. ago\nhow does the reputation system actually work?\n4 upvotes \u00b7 5 comments\nHow does the Reputation System actually work?\nr/Rainbow6\n\u2022\n1 yr. ago\nHow does the Reputation System actually work?\n2 upvotes \u00b7 5 comments\nIs there any kind of Reputation system?\nr/DnD\n\u2022\n11 yr. ago\nIs there any kind of Reputation system?\n4 upvotes \u00b7 9 comments\nFaction/Reputation system that works with D4?\nr/diablo4\n\u2022\n4 yr. ago\nFaction/Reputation system that works with D4?\n13 upvotes \u00b7 5 comments\nHow are you finding the reputation system so far?\nr/Rainbow6\n\u2022\n5 mo. ago\nHow are you finding the reputation system so far?\n228 upvotes \u00b7 138 comments\nReputation System\nr/Rainbow6\n\u2022\n4 mo. ago\nReputation System\n149 upvotes \u00b7 77 comments\nReputation System Idea\nr/DnD\n\u2022\n2 yr. ago\nReputation System Idea\n2 upvotes \u00b7 3 comments\nIs there a game with an Immersive Reputation System?\nr/gaming\n\u2022\n1 yr. ago\nIs there a game with an Immersive Reputation System?\n409 upvotes \u00b7 179 comments\nWhat are the best D&D modules to throw into existing campaigns?\nr/DMAcademy\n\u2022\n6 mo. ago\nWhat are the best D&D modules to throw into existing campaigns?\n65 upvotes \u00b7 61 comments\nLifelong fan of DnD, but I've never fully played\nr/DnD5e\n\u2022\n2 mo. ago\nLifelong fan of DnD, but I've never fully played\n37 upvotes \u00b7 35 comments\nDnD is actually fun!\nr/DnD\n\u2022\n1 mo. ago\nDnD is actually fun!\n70 upvotes \u00b7 8 comments\nRealized after my last game that I am good at creating games but a poor DM.

One of the coolest experiences to have at the table with a character like that is when their reputation proceeds them. When their titles are shouted out in backwater towns, when the lord of the land calls upon them to solve a problem, when their past catches up to them because it\u2019s been hard-won in the crucible of action.\nThere is nothing quite as striking and commanding as a name on the lips of many.\nThere\u2019s a ton of ways to handle reputation in RPGs. In some of them, it\u2019s very mechanical\u2014Worlds Without Number ties your renown to your party\u2019s big downtime project, and you spend it like currency. Others are much looser: in FATE, you might make your high concept \u201cThe Great Mage of the Rotting Forest\u201d and then other players and the GM can tack onto that high concept when they\u2019re invoking it.

I\u2019m striving for something player facing, simple to use, and has the capacity to twist a reputation beyond the truth of the actual events or how the characters want to be known. To do this, we\u2019re going to leverage Trophy Gold combat.\nFirst of all you\u2019ll need to figure out what level of fame your game is operating under, which will decide the reputation dice size. For a legendary big damn heroes game, use a d6. For a nobodies in a big world game, use a d20.\nThe players keep track of their group exploits on a reputation charter, in numbered and chronological order. Each time the group does something extraordinary that would be gossiped about, write down the exploit and number it accordingly. Try to keep it brief enough to fit on one line, and write it in the \u201ctruth\u201d of how the story would be told. \u201cWe defeated The Dragon by cunning and recovered the Hermit\u2019s Sword from his hoard.\u201d\nWhenever there\u2019s a chance that the group might be known by their reputation (entering a new town, meeting someone important, facing a powerful enemy) the dice come out. All dice are the same size, as determined by the scope of fame your game is operating under.\nThe players pick up a number of dice equal to how many exploits they have on their reputation charter. The GM picks a single die.\nThe players roll first, keeping track of which numbers they rolled on the dice. After that, the GM rolls. If the GM\u2019s roll is less than or equal to the total number of exploits on the reputation charter, the group is recognized. The exploit they are known by, if necessary, is the one matching the die roll. If the GM die matches any of the exploit dice rolled by the players, the group is recognized, but the story is twisted. The truth bends, deeds are exaggerated or underplayed, and the group might be painted in a better light or a worse one. If multiple exploit dice come up with the same number and the GM rolls that number, the exploit permanently changes as the twist takes hold as canon.\nHere\u2019s the two rules written in purely technical terms:\nAdd an Exploit\nWhen the group performs a great deed and it is known to the world, record the deed on your reputation charter. Make sure to number it.\nChecking your Reputation\nWhen the group encounters a situation where your past deeds might be known, the GM and players pick up the dice.\nThe players pick up a total number of dice equal to how many exploits they have. It doesn\u2019t matter who rolls the dice, either a single player or spreading them across the entire group.\nThe GM picks up a single die.\nRoll the dice. If the GM\u2019s die was less than or equal to the number of exploits on the reputation charter, the group is known. The exploit that matches the GM\u2019s die is the one they are most known by.\nIf the GM\u2019s die matches any of the player\u2019s exploit dice, one of their exploits is twisted out of true. If multiple exploit dice match the GM\u2019s die, the exploit is permanently twisted out of true. Erase and record the new version of it.\nThat\u2019s it! It\u2019s a pretty simple system, and allows reputation rolls to be relatively quick once everyone gets the hang of things. I find it interesting for a few reasons:\nIf you\u2019re running a big damn heroes game with a d6 exploit die, you\u2019re going to fill your reputation charter pretty fast. I would recommend only allowing a maximum of 1 less than your die size in exploits on the sheet at any time. So a d6 would allow for 5 max, a d12 would allow for 11 max. This means that there\u2019s always a chance that someone just doesn\u2019t know who the hell you are.\nSince you can fill the reputation table, there needs to be a way deplete it as well, especially if you\u2019re using a d6. I would say that for each new exploit that would overflow the table, the players can choose which one to replace. An alternative, if you don\u2019t want to remove old entries, is to start doubling them up. When you\u2019re at max, start at 1 again, so that you end up with multiple entries on the same number. And then the GM can choose which one, or roll randomly, when the die comes up with that number.\nHere\u2019s a table of twists to use if you want to randomize that aspect of the reputation. If the exploit already follows the twist, magnify it. For example, a 1 rolled on an already noble and heroic deed becomes the epitome of heroic and noble.\nDid you enjoy this post?

Also maybe something new has developed in that time.\nDo you use a reputation system and could you recommend it?\nThanks in advance for your input.\n7th Sea* has two mechanics that may help: Reputation, a one-word descriptor that your character earns over time, which gives you a dice bonus when you take an action playing on that rep, and Favor, which makes you more or less popular with a faction and lets you trade in that favor for help.\nIn a campaign, both are rewarding. I've also used \"Infamy,\" which is just negative Favor. The more Infamous you are with a given faction, the more effort they'll put into trying to stop or harm you.\n*(a game I run and write for, so that's why it springs immediately to mind)\ntrack me\nI usually just borrow the \"Reaction\" system from OSR games. Reaction is normally a system used for determining how an unplanned encounter begins and typically uses 2 dice such as 2d6 for the probability (majority of your results will be 6,7,8). Lower results tend to be more unfriendly and hostile (will attack/retreat) while higher results are friendly and allies (will help if they can). And the party will have modifiers depending on their relation with the faction being encountered along with any other skills/traits they may have should factor in. Makes it easy to track faction relations with players then as you can just have a list of factions with a modifier next to them. Also players can easily digest and factor how the system relates to what's going on in the game. When you tell them, your rep goes up to +2, they know that's great and means there's an increased chance of them being recognized and helped by that faction.\nBlades in the dark has a really good faction reputation/status system, that not only tracks your parties overall reputation, but also which factions in the game are allies or enemies.\nIt's definitely tied towards gang-wars style reputation, but might be worth a look.\nFor my newest campaign, I adopted a fallout-like system where on the map it tells you how each settlement feels about you once you\u2019ve visited it. I just adjust it based on Pathfinder\u2019s existing Fame rules, which I altered slightly by removing the spendable game points. Basically when the party does certain things, they gain either fame or infamy. The more famous/infamous, the farther away stories about them are told, which affects how first meetings go. In one of my other campaigns, using a similar system, the party came across a traveler in a country they\u2019ve never been to who shared some stories he\u2019d heard about an adventuring party, never realizing he was speaking with his heroes.\nIt's been ages but I could swear Hackmaster had a pretty detailed Reputation/Honor system...\nIt's one of those things where I like the idea, but whenever we've played a game where it was a thing, it ends up being ignored in favor of just roleplaying it.\nGURPS Reaction modifiers is the closest thing, that's actually seen regular use.\nNot sure what system you are running but if it has levels then there is a simple system Diogo Nogueira post from his website (link below)\nThe basic idea is that you roll a die appropriate for the number of levels you have in your game. Let's say 10 for example. Roll a d10 and if it comes up equal or lower then their reputation precedes them. Add whatever modifiers you want based off of particular deeds or location in the world. Easy to remember and quick so you might actually use it.\nAnyway, link to the article -----> http://oldskulling.blogspot.com/2018/07/your-reputation-precedes-you.html\nLanmark city of adventure has a really aimple and effective system based on wealth, appearance and maneurism that goes on a small scale from 1 to 10. The diffrence betwenn 2people impact the bonus on dice rolls in social interaction.\nReputation systems often are just addons to whatever current system you're using, so keeping the core engine good is more important than anything.\nA simple example of doing it i saw in the Animated Spellbook. Just add a seventh ability score to your standard D&D experience that works pretty much like charisma but not really being it. Other systems do it differently, like Eclipse Phase giving you an array of reputation scores among many different groups of people.\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\nIs

A way for players to determine their standing with a city, faction, or individual. I'm familiar with the reaction roll table from B/X and OSE so I'm looking for something similar to that. Are there any recommendations out there that would mesh well with OSE or could work with an OSR game with a little tweaking? Thanks for the advice in advance!\nI find reputation kind of hard to track, and usually just wing it, but in a past politically focused Star Wars game I used the following:\nThe party as a whole had a score for each faction ranging from 0 to 100. The players knew these numbers.\nRolling under the score on a d100 meant the party could leverage something from the faction, within reason.\nHalve the score for each big ask, issue, penalty, etc. these can stack on a single roll. Impossible ones are no rolls, GM's discretion.\nDebts could be taken in currency against reputation at a 1:100 or 1:1000 ratio, with repayment deadlines and danger level determining the ratio.\ntrack me\nI like the idea of taking out a debt against your reputation there are some potentially interesting interactions there. As for tracking I have individual character sheets for my cities, factions, and important npcs.\nOk. \u2026 I\u2019m not entirely certain. Because the book I\u2019m about to recommend is super thick with detail and resources. I just spent five minutes sort of rapidly looking through the chapter on factions, and I definitely saw some things that might be helpful even if it\u2019s not exactly what you\u2019re looking for.\nDisclaimer. I am not affiliated with you to the creator of the product or the storefront. I\u2019m about to link to. It is free and you did ask for recommendations.\nWorlds without number free\nfull of amazingly useful tables, and tools for world building on every conceivable level from planetary all the way down to your neighborhood. Whatever level you wanna work out.\nI hope this helps. It certainly was not a derail. Like I said, it\u2019s a bit of a dense piece of cake. Delicious but takes a little time to work through.\nPlus one to this. The base editions of Stars Without Number and Worlds Without Number are both free. If referees use nothing else from it the Faction systems can power a lot of dynamic threads and hooks for your players. It can surprise you and help you load balance the narrative aspects to procedurally generated / randomly generated sandbox games.\nThe Faction system resulted in massive changes to how I expected my Stars game to go (a rebel Faction got annihilated by their corporate overlords, trade war enabled the players to stake a huge claim on an agrarian world, etc). The players really enjoy the ones that they play in a setting where things go on with our without them, especially the 3 players who only played 5E before.\nThanks for the suggestion. I actually own WWN but haven't read it in its entirety. I'll have to open it up again and see what that section holds.\nThe forthcoming game HIS MAJESTY THE WORM uses the following reputation system. It can be built out to be different cities/factions using the same system, just tracking the noteworthy deeds discretely.\nArcanum, both a supplement to 1e and a game itself, uses the simple Renown system. Level 1 players start at 0, and then goes up with exploits. A d100 is rolled, and if under maybe that peasant has heard if the PC. Of course the DM had to interpret circumstance with a + or -, depending if the PC is far from home, or out if their circle of influence, etc.\nanother \"half helping\" reply--\ni use reputation as a subset of faction play. i really don't see much value in reputation outside of a faction system, or another way to look at it:: any group that collectively cares about the PCs, and interactions with that group have consequence to the PCs, you might as well define and play as a faction.\nwhat i do is have lil sticky notes for each faction, but i've also done things like create \"faction worksheets\" where reputation can be tracked. and by tracking, i haven't found any formal systems worth the mechanical weight of employing. i prefer just writing a quick note about an interaction on the sticky note (or worksheet), and then next time this faction is encountered i read up the faction's opinion of the PCs and build from there.\nin regards to reaction tables, i only use these when creating from void, as in, absent any information, how does this faction, or individual in the faction react to the PCs? then kinda backfill some narrative in there.\none more quick point: when dealing with reputation, its important to design social encounters to give some TEETH to the whole affair. lower stakes encounters: tests of etiquette, friendly competition like drinking games, romance, mistaken identity, etc. then the party reputation emerges organically.\nCheck out the politics and factions link here\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\nThe party as a whole had a score for each faction ranging from 0 to 100. The players knew these numbers.\nRolling under the score on a d100 meant the party could leverage something from the faction, within reason.\nHalve the score for each big ask, issue, penalty, etc. these can stack on a single roll.

Being more text based than exploration and dialogue. And to make things easier I thought it would be really useful if I could have a points system, called \"charisma\" or \"reputation\" or something similar. And depending on your score it would give different outcomes in dialogue. Prefably I'd like the points to have a cap, so like 0-25 or 0-100 for example\nE. E\nIf you have a reputation of 0 characters will give a dialogue box such as \"begone I don't want to speak with the likes of you.\"\nAnd if you have a reputation of say 100 they'll be more \"omg, you're speaking to me? Hell yeah I'll do that for you.\"\nIf it helps to know for context, I am making a dating simulator parody game style thing that's based on a villan in our dnd games. And I figured this \"points\" system would be much easier to work with than loads of different switches and variables constantly switching on and off.\nYou don't need a plugin for this, this can easily be done using variables. Create a variable called \"Reputation\" or whatever you like. This will be your points counter. After interactions with characters, you can use Control Variables to add or subtract from your Reputation variable.\nYou can have events, like certain dialogue, only trigger when the player's Reputation is greater than or equal to your desired value using the Conditions section on the left side of the event editor. You can also use a conditional branch to do a similar thing.\nGood luck!\ntrack me\nOh wow. That simple, that's great thank you!\nI mean, pick a variable to be your reputation and make dialogue trees around It, its more time consuming than hard.\nEveryone else has already pointed out using variables but if I can add a tip: this gets daunting if you do not keep track of things. Open a word document. Plan things out. List your variables for reference. Make lots and lots of notes as you create the game. Organize as you go. It'll make life easier. This is also just good practice for anything with creating games, but especially when fine tuning a system like this.\nYou wouldn't believe how many people in indie game dev don't write anything down.\nIn addition to this, I recommend Xmind's free version as it makes good left-right flowcharts very easy. These are a gift to branching dialogue writers everywhere.\nI did something similar for my game. I use a favor system and I store a value for each npc. E.g Karl may have 3 favor and Penny may have 5 favor. The key comes down to if your characters can be found in different maps.\nIf not, using variables is fine. 1 event/npc maps to 1 variable. Easy.\nIf they are found on different maps though, you need to keep a list of npc event ids for each map for each individual character - so that when you talk to the same character on a different map you have the same reputation as the previous ones, etc.\nIt really is quite an easy type of plugin whereby you talk to an npc and the plugin knows which npc you are talking to based on the current maps event. Then it can put the reputation into a variable. A little harder, but not too much so.\nNote: if you only need one global reputation that is the same for every character then a simple variable moving up and down as people already suggested is fine.\nJust create a karma / relation variable that ads or subtracts 1 each time you do a certain action.\nI've implemented that on my game, but the dialogs with those changes are just so time consuming...\nSo I scrapped the idea of dialog options to get good or bad karma, and just went with actions instead.\nFor every action you complete (boss, quest, etc) you gain points for a certain faction so that I don't have to code so many dialog options...\nSet each faction's reputation score as a variable. Make events in the story increase or decrease said variable, add conditional paths that diverge if you're above or below a certain threshold.\nAs for implementing it in a menu, I'm sure there's a plugin that can do that.\nHi. Just wanted to say thank you everyone for your suggestions. It seems it really is as simple as a variable.\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\nHelp with a condition based combat system\nr/RPGdesign\n\u2022\n4 yr. ago\nHelp with a

They represent achievements of particular objectives in the community based on contribution activities. Many times, badges are often structured within a hierarchy (e.g., bronze, silver, and gold) in an ascending order of difficulty in earning them. These qualitative levels provide users with a sense of progress that is similar to levels in games. Online communities use badges and leverage their levels to acknowledge contributors for their accomplishments, and therefore, bring them back to the community for further contribution\n[6]\n[6]\n[7]\n[7]\n[8]\n[8]\n[9]\n[9]\nidentified motivational factors for voluntary user contributions can be energized by using design elements such as digital badges has rarely been addressed. Moreover, little is known about the significance of hierarchical levels among badges to engage users in community activities.\n1\n1\n[10]\n[10]\n[11]\n[11]\n, we argue that the externally motivated contribution behavior induced by earned badges becomes more self-determined in periods following the badge awards. This is because earned badges facilitate the process of internalization through which users recognize the value of their contribution behavior and gradually accept it as their own. That is, external motivation provided by badges is experienced as more autonomous after users are rewarded with these accomplishment symbols. As a result, users subsequently contribute to the community in a more self-determined way. To summarize, although pursued badges provide a controlled form of extrinsic motivation, driving contributions from users in their quest for reaching goals, this motivation is progressively internalized with the help of earned badges, which results in a more autonomous form of extrinsic motivation and further contributions. Hence, pursued badges and earned badges work together to facilitate the continued participation behavior among users.\nTable 1\nTable 1\n[7]\n[7]\n[5]\n[5]\n.

First, while prior research examined whether rewarding participants for their voluntary behavior incentivizes contributions, how design elements such as digital badges can motivate voluntary contribution to online communities have been rarely examined. Because tangible rewards may not be effective, many online communities today try to encourage their crowd by offering digital (intangible) rewards in the form of virtual points and badges\n[26]\n[26]\n[27]\n[27]\n[28]\n[28]\n[7]\n[7]\n[8]\n[8]\n[5]\n[5]\n, but fewer studies have explored the quality aspect of knowledge sharing to understand the factors that can explain the helpfulness of contributions\n, but fewer studies have explored the quality aspect of\n[28]\n[28]\n[29]\n[29]\n[5]\n[5]\n[28]\n[28]\nWe aim to fill in these research gaps by answering how the use of design elements such as digital badges that are mainly awarded for quality contributions energizes voluntary user contributions in an online Q&A community.

With this type of extrinsic motivation, users consciously value the goal of the Q&A community to be a repository for sharing knowledge related to programming. They identify with this purpose and become involved in achieving this goal by answering questions posted by other users. These people have strong emotional attachment to the community because being associated with the community is quite fulfilling for them\n[3]\n[3]\n[7]\n[7]\n[47]\n[47]\n[48]\n[48]\n[49]\n[49]\n[3]\n[3]\n. Many virtual badges are designed to recognize user's altruistic behavior and commitment, which helps their affective commitment to an online Q&A community. In summary, many factors that have been identified in prior research as motives for voluntary behavior can be mapped to different categories of motivation under the rubric of SDT, and these categories of motivation are all cultivated by virtual badges.\n[50]\n[50]\n[11]\n[11]\n[8]\n[8]\n[47]\n[47]\n[32]\n[32]\n[51]\n[51]\n. Once the user perceives herself as the source of success, her feeling of autonomy improves. Second, an earned badge essentially delivers positive feedback to the user, signifying her effectance in carrying out the activity. Positive feedback increases perceived competence\n[52]\n[52]\n[11]\n[11]\n[33]\n[33]\n[31]\n[31]\n[33]\n[33]\n[4]\n[4]\n[31]\n[31]\n[10]\n[10]\n[10]\n[10]\n[53]\n[53]\n[54]\n[54]\n[55]\n[55]\n. These studies have collectively documented empirical evidence that performance of individuals improves in the presence of goals. In addition, prior studies have shown that specific and achievable goals better move individuals toward the desired behavior. As badges serve as specific reference points for contributors to target, they can act as effective \u201cgoals\u201d and result in goal-directed contribution behavior among contributors. Thus, we expect that the presence of pursued badges as an achievable goal are positively associated with a user's contribution just like earned badges.\n[27]\n[27]\nthrough a social image. As of January 2012, Stack Overflow had 73 badges, some of which have all three levels while others do not. Badges are awarded for contributions using criteria that incorporate some quality aspect. Peers can vote up and down on each answer to assess its quality. An aggregate score indicates how many users found the answer useful. In addition to peers, the user who asked the question can confirm the answer's quality by accepting an answer as correct. Hence, both dimensions of quality are included in badge definitions.\n2\n2\nWe carry out our empirical analyses by the estimation of a series of fixed-effects panel models. Through these estimations, we test our hypotheses about the impact of earned badges on knowledge contribution both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also test the robustness of our findings by conducting a number of checks to eliminate alternative explanations. The descriptive statistics are reported in\nTable 2\nTable 2\nTable 3\nTable 3\npresents the correlation matrix for our variables.\nTable 2. Summary Statistics.\nTable 2.

First, we estimate the impact of badges on contributions without any control variable in model 1. We observe that the coefficients of the number of gold, silver, and bronze badges are all positive and significant, implying that any kind of newly earned badge gives a significant boost to the answering activity in the next period. After controlling for the effect of the cumulative number of badges in model 2, the impacts of earned badges remain positive and significant. When we control for reputation (both current and cumulative) in model 3, the qualitative impact of earned badges do not change. Even after we add tenure to the specification in model 4 to control for user experience, the impact of recently earned badges are significantly positive. All these results imply that any kind of earned badge increases the level of contribution to the answering activity in the next period. Thus, we conclude that badges are effective to motivate further participation. Hence, our results support H1 well.\nTable 4. The Impact of Earned Badges on Subsequent Contribution.\nTable 4.

Therefore, our findings can also contribute to the literature on gamification that calls for a better understanding of effective design of gamification elements as well as the quantification of the value of a gamified approach\nthat calls for a better understanding of effective design of gamification elements as well as the quantification of the value of a gamified approach\n[61]\n[61]\nto achieve greater involvement among community users. As for the horizontal design, more badges of all levels (namely bronze, silver, and gold) with new rules can be introduced to better target the users with various interests and skills. Similar to product differentiation, badge differentiation can make some badges more attractive to pursue to different user segments. The fact that Stack Overflow has continuously introduced new badges over time confirms the value of horizontal differentiation for community engagement. However, a potential issue of cannibalization has to be carefully assessed while designing the rules for the new badges to make sure that new badges do not reduce the appeal of existing badges. As for the vertical design, Stack Overflow can enrich the current hierarchical badge system with badges from higher levels, like platinum and diamond, to keep contributors increasingly engaged in the community, similar to having various levels in computer games. Users who have already earned gold badges can be incentivized to stay focused to contribute to the community. Even if a new level of badges may not increase contributions from users who are just pursuing to earn badges, for users who contribute for more internalized reasons, a new level of badges would boost subsequent contributions upon earning them. Furthermore, a new badge level can also be useful for veteran community members because users with a large tenure tend to be motivated less by earned badges as compared to new users. In addition, users with a large cumulative number of badges are incentivized less by earned badges as compared to users with a small cumulative number of badges. Hence, with higher badge levels, the Q&A community can mitigate the undesirable effect of tenure and badge history on contributions, or at least alleviate their effects.\n[61]\n[61]\n[62]\n[62]\nOur study is not without limitations. First, we acknowledge that it is very difficult to isolate the impact of a specific badge in our setting. As users can earn multiple badges in a given time period, the effects of earned badges are likely to be confounded with each other. Therefore, we assessed the average impact of a badge based on its level using various econometric models. Similarly, it is possible that the badges recognizing the answering activity may have a stronger effect on our dependent variable (i.e., the number of answers) than other types of badges. Nevertheless, we have argued that the needs for\n, we cannot show the detailed link between intrinsic motivational factors/internalization of extrinsic factors and badges. To propose an optimal hierarchical badge system, one has to understand the underlying psychological constructs that are triggered by earned badges in motivating users to contribute to the online Q&A community. More research based on survey and experimental methodologies is needed to assess how earned badges support the relationship between the satisfaction of three kinds of psychological needs and different regulatory styles in various phases of internalization.\n: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, and Writing - Original Draft and Data Curation.\nTables A1\nTables A1\nA2\nA2\nA3\nA3\nA4\nA4\nA4a\nA4a\nA5\nA5\nA6\nA6\nTable A1.

They represent achievements of particular objectives in the community based on contribution activities. Many times, badges are often structured within a hierarchy (e.g., bronze, silver, and gold) in an ascending order of difficulty in earning them. These qualitative levels provide users with a sense of progress that is similar to levels in games. Online communities use badges and leverage their levels to acknowledge contributors for their accomplishments, and therefore, bring them back to the community for further contribution\n[6]\n[6]\n[7]\n[7]\n[8]\n[8]\n[9]\n[9]\nidentified motivational factors for voluntary user contributions can be energized by using design elements such as digital badges has rarely been addressed. Moreover, little is known about the significance of hierarchical levels among badges to engage users in community activities.\n1\n1\n[10]\n[10]\n[11]\n[11]\n, we argue that the externally motivated contribution behavior induced by earned badges becomes more self-determined in periods following the badge awards. This is because earned badges facilitate the process of internalization through which users recognize the value of their contribution behavior and gradually accept it as their own. That is, external motivation provided by badges is experienced as more autonomous after users are rewarded with these accomplishment symbols. As a result, users subsequently contribute to the community in a more self-determined way. To summarize, although pursued badges provide a controlled form of extrinsic motivation, driving contributions from users in their quest for reaching goals, this motivation is progressively internalized with the help of earned badges, which results in a more autonomous form of extrinsic motivation and further contributions. Hence, pursued badges and earned badges work together to facilitate the continued participation behavior among users.\nTable 1\nTable 1\n[7]\n[7]\n[5]\n[5]\n.

First, while prior research examined whether rewarding participants for their voluntary behavior incentivizes contributions, how design elements such as digital badges can motivate voluntary contribution to online communities have been rarely examined. Because tangible rewards may not be effective, many online communities today try to encourage their crowd by offering digital (intangible) rewards in the form of virtual points and badges\n[26]\n[26]\n[27]\n[27]\n[28]\n[28]\n[7]\n[7]\n[8]\n[8]\n[5]\n[5]\n, but fewer studies have explored the quality aspect of knowledge sharing to understand the factors that can explain the helpfulness of contributions\n, but fewer studies have explored the quality aspect of\n[28]\n[28]\n[29]\n[29]\n[5]\n[5]\n[28]\n[28]\nWe aim to fill in these research gaps by answering how the use of design elements such as digital badges that are mainly awarded for quality contributions energizes voluntary user contributions in an online Q&A community.

Satisfaction of the needs of employees for autonomy, competence, and relatedness at work was positively related to work engagement\n[43]\n[43]\n[44]\n[44]\n[32]\n[32]\n[11]\n[11]\n[45]\n[45]\n[46]\n[46]\nSome users have identified regulation for contribution. With this type of extrinsic motivation, users consciously value the goal of the Q&A community to be a repository for sharing knowledge related to programming. They identify with this purpose and become involved in achieving this goal by answering questions posted by other users. These people have strong emotional attachment to the community because being associated with the community is quite fulfilling for them\n[3]\n[3]\n[7]\n[7]\n[47]\n[47]\n[48]\n[48]\n[49]\n[49]\n[3]\n[3]\n. Many virtual badges are designed to recognize user's altruistic behavior and commitment, which helps their affective commitment to an online Q&A community. In summary, many factors that have been identified in prior research as motives for voluntary behavior can be mapped to different categories of motivation under the rubric of SDT, and these categories of motivation are all cultivated by virtual badges.\n[50]\n[50]\n[11]\n[11]\n[8]\n[8]\n[47]\n[47]\n[32]\n[32]\n[51]\n[51]\n. Once the user perceives herself as the source of success, her feeling of autonomy improves. Second, an earned badge essentially delivers positive feedback to the user, signifying her effectance in carrying out the activity. Positive feedback increases perceived competence\n[52]\n[52]\n[11]\n[11]\n[33]\n[33]\n[31]\n[31]\n[33]\n[33]\n[4]\n[4]\n[31]\n[31]\n[10]\n[10]\n[10]\n[10]\n[53]\n[53]\n[54]\n[54]\n[55]\n[55]\n. These studies have collectively documented empirical evidence that performance of individuals improves in the presence of goals. In addition, prior studies have shown that specific and achievable goals better move individuals toward the desired behavior. As badges serve as specific reference points for contributors to target, they can act as effective \u201cgoals\u201d and result in goal-directed contribution behavior among contributors. Thus, we expect that the presence of pursued badges as an achievable goal are positively associated with a user's contribution just like earned badges.\n[27]\n[27]\nthrough a social image. As of January 2012, Stack Overflow had 73 badges, some of which have all three levels while others do not. Badges are awarded for contributions using criteria that incorporate some quality aspect. Peers can vote up and down on each answer to assess its quality. An aggregate score indicates how many users found the answer useful. In addition to peers, the user who asked the question can confirm the answer's quality by accepting an answer as correct. Hence, both dimensions of quality are included in badge definitions.\n2\n2\nWe carry out our empirical analyses by the estimation of a series of fixed-effects panel models. Through these estimations, we test our hypotheses about the impact of earned badges on knowledge contribution both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also test the robustness of our findings by conducting a number of checks to eliminate alternative explanations. The descriptive statistics are reported in\nTable 2\nTable 2\nTable 3\nTable 3\npresents the correlation matrix for our variables.\nTable 2. Summary Statistics.\nTable 2.

First, we estimate the impact of badges on contributions without any control variable in model 1. We observe that the coefficients of the number of gold, silver, and bronze badges are all positive and significant, implying that any kind of newly earned badge gives a significant boost to the answering activity in the next period. After controlling for the effect of the cumulative number of badges in model 2, the impacts of earned badges remain positive and significant. When we control for reputation (both current and cumulative) in model 3, the qualitative impact of earned badges do not change. Even after we add tenure to the specification in model 4 to control for user experience, the impact of recently earned badges are significantly positive. All these results imply that any kind of earned badge increases the level of contribution to the answering activity in the next period. Thus, we conclude that badges are effective to motivate further participation. Hence, our results support H1 well.\nTable 4. The Impact of Earned Badges on Subsequent Contribution.\nTable 4.

Specifically, the coefficients of a bronze badge in models 1, 2, and 3 are 0.406, 0.654, and 0.748, respectively. Hence, although earning a bronze badge always boosts users\u2019 incentive to subsequently answer more questions, users with at least a silver badge answer more questions than users with only bronze badges. Similarly, users with at least a gold badge answer more questions than users with only bronze and silver badges. This relationship also holds for silver badges.

Thus, although earning a silver badge always incentivizes users to subsequently answer more questions, users with at least a gold badge answer more questions than users with only bronze and silver badges.

Therefore, our findings can also contribute to the literature on gamification that calls for a better understanding of effective design of gamification elements as well as the quantification of the value of a gamified approach\nthat calls for a better understanding of effective design of gamification elements as well as the quantification of the value of a gamified approach\n[61]\n[61]\nto achieve greater involvement among community users. As for the horizontal design, more badges of all levels (namely bronze, silver, and gold) with new rules can be introduced to better target the users with various interests and skills. Similar to product differentiation, badge differentiation can make some badges more attractive to pursue to different user segments. The fact that Stack Overflow has continuously introduced new badges over time confirms the value of horizontal differentiation for community engagement. However, a potential issue of cannibalization has to be carefully assessed while designing the rules for the new badges to make sure that new badges do not reduce the appeal of existing badges. As for the vertical design, Stack Overflow can enrich the current hierarchical badge system with badges from higher levels, like platinum and diamond, to keep contributors increasingly engaged in the community, similar to having various levels in computer games. Users who have already earned gold badges can be incentivized to stay focused to contribute to the community. Even if a new level of badges may not increase contributions from users who are just pursuing to earn badges, for users who contribute for more internalized reasons, a new level of badges would boost subsequent contributions upon earning them. Furthermore, a new badge level can also be useful for veteran community members because users with a large tenure tend to be motivated less by earned badges as compared to new users. In addition, users with a large cumulative number of badges are incentivized less by earned badges as compared to users with a small cumulative number of badges. Hence, with higher badge levels, the Q&A community can mitigate the undesirable effect of tenure and badge history on contributions, or at least alleviate their effects.\n[61]\n[61]\n[62]\n[62]\nOur study is not without limitations. First, we acknowledge that it is very difficult to isolate the impact of a specific badge in our setting. As users can earn multiple badges in a given time period, the effects of earned badges are likely to be confounded with each other. Therefore, we assessed the average impact of a badge based on its level using various econometric models. Similarly, it is possible that the badges recognizing the answering activity may have a stronger effect on our dependent variable (i.e., the number of answers) than other types of badges. Nevertheless, we have argued that the needs for\n, we cannot show the detailed link between intrinsic motivational factors/internalization of extrinsic factors and badges. To propose an optimal hierarchical badge system, one has to understand the underlying psychological constructs that are triggered by earned badges in motivating users to contribute to the online Q&A community. More research based on survey and experimental methodologies is needed to assess how earned badges support the relationship between the satisfaction of three kinds of psychological needs and different regulatory styles in various phases of internalization.\n: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, and Writing - Original Draft and Data Curation.\nTables A1\nTables A1\nA2\nA2\nA3\nA3\nA4\nA4\nA4a\nA4a\nA5\nA5\nA6\nA6\nTable A1.

We added digital badging to the curriculum in its third year of programming (2018). This article describes methods and student feedback about digital badging, allowing others to implement similar technology-driven opportunities to engage youth and promote healthy living. Program staff created seven online experiences (XPs) on health advocacy that made up a playlist. Students adopted three adults as clients and completed four XPs themselves and three with clients. Completion of all XPs resulted in a digital badge-an electronic portfolio of health advocacy experiences to be shared with employers and colleges. Following the 2019 cohort's completion of the digital badge, we conducted two focus groups with students about their feedback on the digital badge. Results showed that students most liked the healthy eating and cardiopulmonary resuscitation XPs. They had more positive reactions to the experience than negative, and especially appreciated aspects of active learning, as well as the badge's long-term benefits. This technology can potentially help any student with access to an electronic device become a health advocate, and could become a new tool for career development while improving population health.\nKeywords: adolescents; digital badging; focus groups; health promotion; public health; urban population.\nPubMed Disclaimer\nNCBI Literature Resources\nMeSH PMC Bookshelf Disclaimer\nThe PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

No problem.\nPost navigation\nLatest News\nStay in Touch\nCategories\nRecent Posts\nStarting this week, the Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH) will begin issuing Professional Badges for student completion statewide. Badges are portable records of completion and indicators of success that are rendered as digital icons and can be included in resumes and other displays of achievement. CCSNH anticipates that more than 800 credentials will be given to students who completed programs through the colleges\u2019 Business and Training Centers as part of this first phase.\n\u201cA student who completes a program through the Business Training Center at a community college will still be given paper credentials,\u201d says Dr. Larissa Baia, President of Lakes Region Community College, \u201cand now they will also be able to share their success and abilities with potential employers, friends and family by posting their digital badges on Linked-In, Facebook and other social media accounts. Professional badges can be stand-alone or can be stacked into degrees and certificates to support a variety of pathways into careers,\u201d Baia noted, \u201cwhich adds to their value.\u201d\nAs a digital icon, badges will embed details of learning achievement such as a full listing of competencies each badge represents. This will allow those who hold them to have a more rich and meaningful conversation with a potential employer about the skills that each badge represents. \u201cWe are excited to see this roll out across all the community colleges in the state. And we believe that digital badging will transform the learning ecosystem for our students and for employers locally and across New Hampshire,\u201d said Tim Sink, President of the Concord Chamber of Commerce.\nFor more information about Professional Badges and how they can be used by individuals and hiring managers, please email Andrew Fisher: afisher@ccsnh.edu.\nAbout CCSNH\nThe Community College System of NH consists of seven colleges, offering associate degree and certificate programs, professional training, transfer pathways to four-year degrees, and dual-credit partnerships with NH high schools. The System\u2019s colleges are Great Bay Community College in Portsmouth and Rochester; Lakes Region Community College in Laconia; Manchester Community College; Nashua Community College; NHTI \u2013 Concord\u2019s Community College; River Valley Community College in Claremont, Lebanon and Keene; and White Mountains Community College in Berlin, Littleton and North Conway. The seven community colleges in the system are committed to working with businesses throughout the state to train and retain employees to develop a robust workforce across all sectors and embraces the \u201c65 by 25 Initiative,\u201d which calls for 65% of NH citizens to have some form of postsecondary education by 2025 to meet future workforce demands.\nOver the past 12 years, tuition at New Hampshire\u2019s seven community colleges has increased by only $5 per credit for New Hampshire residents.\nIn this season of graduations, many high school students across New Hampshire are celebrating dual degrees by earning both a high school diploma and an associate degree from one of New Hampshire\u2019s seven community colleges.\nThe Board of Trustees of the Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH) unanimously confirmed Dr. James Keane as the next president of Nashua Community College (NCC) during their meeting this week.\nSign up for our newsletter\nVideo

Drawing on reinforcement theory and attribution theory of motivation, we conjecture that nonrepeatable badges reinforce individuals\u2019 behaviors primarily by promoting internal attributions that strengthen their self-determination motivation, while repeatable badges reinforce people\u2019s behaviors mainly via external attributions that undermine their self-determination motivation. By using fixed-effects models to analyze a panel data, we observe that nonrepeatable badges can better motivate users to share their knowledge than repeatable badges. In addition, the results show that attaining a higher level of nonrepeatable badges is associated with an increased effect for knowledge sharing, and that attaining a higher level of repeated badges leads to a decreased effect. These findings can contribute to extant literature by offering a probable explanation regarding why some gamified awards can motivate people better than others.\nWen, Bo; Hu, Paul; and Xu, Anqi, \"Examining Effects of Badge Repeatability and Level on Users\u2019 Knowledge Sharing in Online Q&A Communities\" (2023).

Future of Digital Credentials\nLinkedin Badges\nWhat Is Digital Badging and How It is Used?\nLeave a Reply\nDigital Attribute\nRichness of Metadata\nInteraction\nPortability\nVerification\nTalent Badges\nAchievement Badges\nEngagement Badges\nRecognition Badges\nIn a world where technological innovations shape every aspect of human interaction, the concept of recognition does not seem untouched. As digital landscapes expand and infiltrate our lives, traditional forms of recognition of achievements have been reshaped with a digital touch, resulting in the birth of virtual badges.\nThese digital recognition symbols transcend physical boundaries and geographic limitations, with the power to revolutionize how we perceive and celebrate achievements. This article dives deep into digital badges, examining their origin, evolution, and profound impact on recognition dynamics in the digital age.\nIn the recent past, recognition often involved receiving a tangible certificate, trophy, or medal. These physical representations often symbolized proudly displayed achievements in homes or offices. However, the rise of the internet and the subsequent proliferation of online platforms have brought new possibilities for recognition. Virtual badges arose as digital counterparts to traditional recognition symbols, which often appeared as colored icons or logos.\nThe transition from physical recognition to digital is not just a matter of aesthetics; it\u2019s a shift that fits perfectly with our digital lifestyles. In a world where so much of our communication, learning, and even work takes place online, recognition is inevitable. The ease of sharing and displaying these badges on various online platforms has led them to become powerful tools for individuals to organize their digital identities and showcase their achievements to a global audience.\nThe virtual badge phenomenon is not confined to a specific area; instead, it is a phenomenon that spans beyond education to employment and online communities. Each field embraces these badges uniquely, and these digital signs\u2019 impact on our collective psychology is impossible to ignore. Subjects such as the psychology of their motivations, potential for abuse, and their role in shaping digital interaction dynamics require rigorous exploration.\nIn navigating this complex landscape, it is essential to understand the meaning of virtual badges and evaluate the benefits and potential disadvantages they bring. The lure of recognition and the gamification of achievements raise questions about fairness, equality, and broader implications for society.\nVirtual badges are digital representations of achievements, skills, or achievements and serve as a form of recognition, validation, and motivation in the digital age. Unlike traditional physical badges, which are usually made of metal or plastic and can be worn on clothing, virtual badges exist in the digital world and can be shared, displayed, and verified online.\nThe concept of digital badging is rooted in the open-source software movement and the need to recognize the efforts of contributors in online communities. Launched in 2011, the Mozilla Open Badges project has played a vital role in popularizing the idea of digital badging. This initiative aimed to create a standardized system for creating, issuing, and displaying online badges on various platforms. Since then, the concept has been embraced by industries ranging from software development to education, professional development, and social media.\nVirtual badges have some distinctive features that distinguish them from traditional recognition methods:\nVirtual badges are available in digital formats, such as image files or metadata, so they can be easily shared across online platforms.\nIn addition to visual representation, badges often contain metadata such as the name of the issuer, date of issue, criteria for earning the badge, and evidence of success. This metadata adds credibility and context to the badge.\nSome virtual badges can be interactive; when users click on the badges, they can access additional information about the achievement or the criteria set for earning the badge.\nWhile physical badges can stay in a specific location, virtual badges can be displayed on a variety of online platforms, from social media profiles to personal websites.\nWith the rise of blockchain technology, some virtual badges can now be verified through decentralized ledgers, thus avoiding fraudulent and misleading claims.\nVirtual badges come in different forms to suit specific contexts:\nThese badges recognize particular skills, abilities, or specializations. They are common in educational settings and professional development.\nAchievement badges recognize milestones or achievements, such as completing a course, reaching a certain level in a game, or making a significant contribution to a project.\nThese badges are awarded for active participation and sharing in online communities, encouraging collaboration and interaction.\nRecognition badges celebrate various forms of recognition, from employee of the month awards to outstanding contributions within the community.\nVirtual badges offer a variety of values to winners, and these values reflect an innovative approach to the digital format of recognition of achievements and motivation.\nVirtual badges are a powerful tool for individuals to recognize and validate their achievements. Individuals who successfully perform various activities, such as completing a task, acquiring a skill, or contributing to a project, earn these badges and receive a formal recognition of their efforts and abilities. This affirmation allows a person to see their achievements in a tangible way and can increase self-confidence.\nVirtual badges can encourage individuals to strive harder and achieve their goals. The criteria required to earn a badge can lead individuals to challenge themselves and hone their skills. At the same time, the purpose of earning badges can motivate individuals to reach higher standards and initiate a process of continuous learning and improvement.\nVirtual badges allow individuals to showcase their talents and achievements visually. These badges can be integrated into the profiles or CVs of students, professionals or online community members. In this way, individuals can use their earned badges as a portfolio and present them to potential employers or educational institutions. This can help winners stand out in the market and in a competitive environment.\nVirtual badges can strengthen ties within online communities. Earning badges as part of a community can build a bond between members and encourage greater participation in the community. Badges can create a sense of solidarity and interaction among members, especially in online interactions such as in-game teams or discussion groups in forums.\nVirtual badges allow individuals to reliably communicate their skills and achievements to potential employers or training providers to validate their achievements. The badges\u2019 metadata clearly shows what kind of skills the winners have and how they achieved them. This can facilitate the winners\u2019 process of proving their talent and help them use it as a valuable tool.\nOverall, virtual badges provide winners with tangible recognition, a motivating goal, personal branding, and the opportunity to strengthen community bonds. By adapting to the dynamics of the digital age, the celebration of successes and emotional development processes are made more effective and exciting.\nThere are a number of important factors that organizations should consider when investing in virtual badges. These factors include the strategy, technology, and processes required to implement and manage virtual badges effectively.\nOrganizations should determine why they want to use virtual badges and what goals they aim to achieve. Badges can be used, for example, to increase employee motivation, promote certain skills, or strengthen community engagement. When the objectives are clarified, the design of the badges, criteria to be earned, and distribution strategies can be better shaped.\nThe criteria and standards required to earn virtual badges should be clear and measurable. This increases the credibility and value of badges. For example, determine which tasks need to be completed for skill badges or what levels of interaction are required for participation badges. Setting criteria also ensures that winners receive the badges they deserve.\nThe design of virtual badges should be visually appealing and meaningful. Badges should be designed to help winners understand and share their achievements. Visual design can ensure badges reflect the identity of the organization or community. Therefore, care must be taken in the design process.\nNecessary technology infrastructure should be provided to manage virtual badges effectively. This includes platforms for creating, issuing, earning, sharing, and validating badges. It is also essential to ensure the credibility of badges using blockchain or similar technologies.\nThe privacy and security of data associated with virtual badges is of paramount importance. Necessary measures should be taken to protect personal information and prevent unauthorized access. In addition, data management and retention policies should be clarified.\nThe experience of badge winners can significantly affect the effectiveness of virtual badges. A user-friendly interface and an intuitive process can help winners seamlessly manage the process of earning, sharing, and verifying badges.\nThere should be clear communication about the purpose, value, and how to use the virtual badge program. The benefits and operation of the program should be clearly explained to both winners and potential winners. This can increase badge acceptance and engagement.\nThe effectiveness of the virtual badge program should be regularly evaluated, and improvements should be made as needed. Feedback among the winners should be collected, and how close the program\u2019s goals should be tracked. Based on the evaluation results, the program can be optimized.\nThe virtual badge program should be designed and managed with a long-term perspective. The sustainability of the program must be ensured in accordance with long-term goals and changing needs.\nBadge winners and other stakeholders should be trained and supported on how to use the program. Users must understand how to earn, share, and verify badges.\nOrganizations should consider various scenarios of how to use virtual badges. For example, will it be used in education, to promote professional development, or to increase engagement in online communities? Developing strategies suitable for different scenarios can increase the success of the badge program.\nBadge programs should address a variety of skills, abilities, and participant profiles. Taking an inclusive approach can ensure that different groups and individuals benefit from the program.\nVirtual badges are a tool used to reward success and motivate. However, obtaining too simple or difficult badges can weaken the program\u2019s effectiveness. Earning badges should be a challenge but a goal within reach of winners.\nAs a result, it is essential for organizations to consider their purpose, user experience, technology infrastructure, and long-term strategies when investing in virtual badges. Effectively implemented and managed, virtual badge programs can effectively recognize achievements, increase participation, and create a motivating environment.\nWith the rapid development of the digital age, traditional concepts and processes have entered a process of significant change and transformation. This shift has also impacted rewards and recognition, and digital symbols such as virtual badges have become a new expression of achievements and talents. The topic we cover in this article, titled \u201cWhat Are Virtual Badges: Recognition in the Digital Age,\u201d covers the innovations virtual badges bring to recognition systems and the value they provide to winners.\nVirtual badges offer various values to winners. Recognition and acknowledgment increase the motivation of individuals, while visual proof ensures that talents are proven in the digital world. Badges also help with skill and talent mapping while offering the opportunity to reach a wider audience through social networks. In addition to increasing job opportunities, it supports personal and professional development processes.\nThere are a number of factors that organizations should consider when investing in virtual badges. Well-defined criteria allow winners to understand the value and badges better. The technological infrastructure enables badges to be managed and shared effectively. The visual design makes the badges appear effectively and attractively. The content development process ensures the successful execution of the program. Evaluation and communication strategies provide the continuous development and participation of the program.\nVirtual badges represent the digital future of rewards and recognition systems. This innovative approach makes individuals\u2019 achievements more visible and supports their learning and development processes. These digital symbols, which replace traditional badges, offer tangible and meaningful values to winners while offering organizations a more effective and measurable reward system.\nYour email address will not be published.

Our platform offers customizable gamification features to make implementing these techniques effortless so you can spur member toward participation and loyalty.\nGamification Best Practices\nEvaluating and Analyzing Gamification Success\nMaking Gamification Work for You\nHave Questions?\nProducts\nAdditional Information\nLearn More\nWe value your privacy\nWe use cookies to enhance your browsing experience, serve personalized ads or content, and analyze our traffic.

Privacy Policy\nAs an association professional or community manager, gamification can help you bolster member engagement within your online community. We see gamification tactics more and more widely used across a variety of sectors. Salesforce incorporates gamification in its CRM platform, motivating sales teams through leaderboards and badges. Duolingo utilizes gamification to make learning a new language entertaining, employing a point system and streaks to encourage consistent practice. I\u2019ve personally been taken in by the rewards and incentives in Apple Fitness+. The monthly challenges, workout streaks, and special event badges motivate me to try new activities and push myself further in my fitness journey. As someone who works in tech, I understand what they are trying to do, and it\u2019s working.\nAs the concept continues to evolve, more organizations, ranging from education platforms to employee training programs, are embracing gamification to drive participation and achieve specific objectives \u2013 and associations should too! Here are some practical insights into why gamification works and some ideas for how you can use it.\nGamification is an influential strategy that employs game-design elements and principles in non-game contexts to encourage and reward desired actions and behaviors. But how exactly does gamification work and why is it effective?\nThe goal of gamification is to tap into the psychological aspects of human behavior associated with gaming. It capitalizes on our human instincts for competition, achievement, rewards, and a sense of accomplishment, cultivating an immersive and stimulating environment that motivates users to participate.\nGamification involves integrating elements commonly found in games, such as points, badges, leaderboards, challenges, and rewards, into various activities or processes to make them more enjoyable and engaging. It\u2019s most easily implemented through digital platforms, like online communities and mobile apps, but it can also be incorporated into physical environments, depending on the context and objectives.\nYou can see gamification applied in various fields, including education, business, marketing, and health, to enhance user engagement, learning, and performance. Again, picture the way apps like Duolingo and Apple Fitness+ use badge rewards, leaderboards, and activity streaks to keep people coming back. Organizations use gamification tactics to increase motivation, foster collaboration, and improve user satisfaction.\nIntegrating gamification into online communities can substantially benefit your member engagement and your association. It injects excitement into routine tasks, encourages participation, and creates a fun kind of urgency for members to do what you want them to do. From earning points and unlocking badges, to competing on leaderboards, game-like elements can motivate members to log into your online community, participate actively, and stay engaged. Gamification boosts member retention and loyalty by rewarding members for interaction and collaboration.\nRemember that the key to gamification is creating a structure of incentives that reward users for performing desired actions. You\u2019re creating mechanics that evoke the social aspects of gaming, like competition, cooperation, and achievement. The gamification elements you use can and should be tailored to the objectives and nature of your target audience and online community. Consider factors like user motivations, desired behaviors, and desired outcomes to create engaging and rewarding experiences.\nSome common types of gamification include:\nAlthough there are some common gamification methods and themes, incorporating gamification into your online community can be pretty customizable \u2013 from deciding what activities will result in points and badges for your members, to naming your badges and ranks. This can be exciting and fun, but it\u2019s important to go in with a plan so you don\u2019t end up creating a confusing, disjointed collection of experiences that feel completely random to your members. To ensure the success of your gamification strategy, it\u2019s a good idea to observe some best practices.\nHere are three key considerations:\nRemember, gamification should complement your community\u2019s purpose and enhance the overall experience, resulting in a thriving and active online community.\nRegular evaluation is essential to ensuring that your gamification strategies are working and having the intended effect. Tracking user engagement metrics is a vital aspect for measuring the success of your gamification efforts.\nBy continuously reviewing and optimizing gamification elements, you can keep your community members engaged, motivated, and actively participating in the community.\nGamification has proven its effectiveness in driving engagement and participation in online communities. By incorporating game elements into the community experience, organizations have successfully enhanced user interactions, increased loyalty, and achieved their goals. Whether you\u2019re a professional association looking to boost member engagement or an e-commerce platform seeking to drive customer loyalty, gamification can be customized to meet specific objectives, fostering an immersive and rewarding experience for your online communities.\nSarah Spinosa is the Director of Product Marketing for Higher Logic\u2019s association line of business.

By awarding points and badges for activities such as posting content, answering questions, serving as a volunteer, or participating in events, you can recognize and celebrate members\u2019 efforts, fostering a sense of pride and status within the community (Bonus: you also boost awareness of the programs they\u2019re involved in).\nProgress Bars: Show users their progress toward specific goals or achievements, like completing their profile. Highlighting how far they\u2019ve gotten and noting incomplete tasks gives members a checklist of things to complete in order to reach 100%.\nPoints, Leaderboards, and Ranks: Display a leaderboard ranking top contributors or active members. This fosters friendly competition and recognizes your members who are actively participating. You could also try awarding levels or ranks (like gold, silver, bronze) when users reach a certain level of activity. Newcomers often start with a \u201cnewbie\u201d or \u201cnewcomer\u201d designation, and you can assign titles with names that fit your brand personality. Remember to consider all the ways someone can interact with your community (consumer, contributor, creator levels) and try to meet them on their level.\nQuests, Pathways, Goals, or Challenges: Guide members through a specific set of actions or educational modules with quests or pathways that give them a list of things to complete to achieve a badge. Providing your members with this clear goal within your online community can drive participation and create a sense of purpose. One company that has embraced this method of gamification is Salesforce, which employs what they call \u201ctrailheads.\u201d\nAlign gamification with community goals: Before implementing gamification, it\u2019s crucial to align it with your community\u2019s goals. Clearly define what you want to achieve through gamification and how it aligns with your overall community objectives. For example, if your goal is to increase knowledge sharing, consider implementing badges or leaderboards to recognize and reward users who contribute valuable insights.\nEnsure fairness and transparency: To maintain user trust and engagement, it\u2019s essential to ensure fairness and transparency in your gamification system. Clearly communicate the rules, criteria, and rewards associated with each gamified activity. Avoid creating a system that favors a select few and instead promote equal opportunities for all community members to participate and succeed.\nCreate a positive user experience: The success of gamification relies on providing a positive user experience. Design your gamification elements in a way that enhances user engagement and enjoyment. Consider factors such as visual appeal, intuitive navigation, and responsive design. Additionally, regularly gather user feedback to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments to optimize the user experience.\nMonitor metrics like active participation, time spent on your online community, and the number of completed challenges or quests, to gauge the level of engagement and the impact that your gamification efforts on your online community. You want to challenge your members but not make accomplishments such a reach that people lose interest.\nMonitor the performance of gamified activities before and after you implement gamification to see if participation is trending upward. Then decide if you need to enhance the gamification experience. You may want to review the number of points you\u2019re awarding for certain activities \u2013 do they still align with your objectives?\nCollect feedback from your members to see if they\u2019re (A) aware of the ways they can be rewarded for participating in your community, and (B) have input into how they\u2019re rewarded and what they\u2019re rewarded for. Consider making this a part of an annual community survey \u2013 you\u2019ll be surprised how feedback empowers you to level up!\nBadges and achievements: Badges and achievements serve as visual representations of members\u2019 accomplishments and contributions. By awarding points and badges for activities such as posting content, answering questions, serving as a volunteer, or participating in events, you can recognize and celebrate members\u2019 efforts, fostering a sense of pride and status within the community (Bonus: you also boost awareness of the programs they\u2019re involved in).\nProgress Bars: Show users their progress toward specific goals or achievements, like completing their profile. Highlighting how far they\u2019ve gotten and noting incomplete tasks gives members a checklist of things to complete in order to reach 100%.\nPoints, Leaderboards, and Ranks: Display a leaderboard ranking top contributors or active members. This fosters friendly competition and recognizes your members who are actively participating. You could also try awarding levels or ranks (like gold, silver, bronze) when users reach a certain level of activity. Newcomers often start with a \u201cnewbie\u201d or \u201cnewcomer\u201d designation, and you can assign titles with names that fit your brand personality. Remember to consider all the ways someone can interact with your community (consumer, contributor, creator levels) and try to meet them on their level.\nQuests, Pathways, Goals, or Challenges: Guide members through a specific set of actions or educational modules with quests or pathways that give them a list of things to complete to achieve a badge. Providing your members with this clear goal within your online community can drive participation and create a sense of purpose. One company that has embraced this method of gamification is Salesforce, which employs what they call \u201ctrailheads.\u201d\nAlign gamification with community goals: Before implementing gamification, it\u2019s crucial to align it with your community\u2019s goals. Clearly define what you want to achieve through gamification and how it aligns with your overall community objectives. For example, if your goal is to increase knowledge sharing, consider implementing badges or leaderboards to recognize and reward users who contribute valuable insights.\nEnsure fairness and transparency: To maintain user trust and engagement, it\u2019s essential to ensure fairness and transparency in your gamification system. Clearly communicate the rules, criteria, and rewards associated with each gamified activity. Avoid creating a system that favors a select few and instead promote equal opportunities for all community members to participate and succeed.\nCreate a positive user experience: The success of gamification relies on providing a positive user experience. Design your gamification elements in a way that enhances user engagement and enjoyment. Consider factors such as visual appeal, intuitive navigation, and responsive design. Additionally, regularly gather user feedback to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments to optimize the user experience.\nMonitor metrics like active participation, time spent on your online community, and the number of completed challenges or quests, to gauge the level of engagement and the impact that your gamification efforts on your online community. You want to challenge your members but not make accomplishments such a reach that people lose interest.\nMonitor the performance of gamified activities before and after you implement gamification to see if participation is trending upward. Then decide if you need to enhance the gamification experience. You may want to review the number of points you\u2019re awarding for certain activities \u2013 do they still align with your objectives?\nCollect feedback from your members to see if they\u2019re (A) aware of the ways they can be rewarded for participating in your community, and (B) have input into how they\u2019re rewarded and what they\u2019re rewarded for.
