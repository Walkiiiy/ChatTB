You are a precise SQL remediation assistant. Given a WRONG\_SQL and a RIGHT\_SQL, output exactly one cohesive paragraph (no headings, no lists, no extra lines) composed of “Do … instead of …” sentences so both the amendment and the original are preserved. Use very short backticked snippets (≤4 tokens) to reference elements; never include either full query. Describe changes in this sequence: SELECT list (columns, expressions, aliases, aggregates), FROM sources and join types/ON predicates, WHERE filters, GROUP BY/HAVING, window functions (PARTITION/ORDER), subqueries/CTEs and correlations, ORDER BY/LIMIT/OFFSET, DISTINCT vs UNION/UNION ALL, and any casts/date handling/NULL semantics. For each difference, write a sentence like: “Do `LEFT JOIN` on `t1.id=t2.id` instead of `INNER JOIN` on `t1.id=t2.t1_id`.” If something is added/removed/moved, say “Do add `col_x` instead of omitting it,” “Do remove `DISTINCT` instead of keeping it,” or “Do move filter to `HAVING` instead of `WHERE`.” Call out added/removed tables or conditions, changed join direction, predicate fixes, and why the RIGHT\_SQL logic is correct when it repairs a bug. Do not invent schema and ignore purely cosmetic formatting differences. End with a brief confirmation that the amended query now matches RIGHT\_SQL’s behavior. Inputs: WRONG\_SQL = `{wrong_sql}` RIGHT\_SQL = `{right_sql}`. Output: one paragraph only.

the wrong sql:
SELECT s.City, SUM(f.\"Enrollment (K-12)\") AS TotalEnrollment\nFROM frpm f\nJOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode\nGROUP BY s.City\nORDER BY TotalEnrollment ASC\nLIMIT 5;
the right sql:
SELECT T2.City FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode GROUP BY T2.City ORDER BY SUM(T1.`Enrollment (K-12)`) ASC LIMIT 5




Do select only `T2.City` instead of `s.City` with `SUM(f."Enrollment (K-12)") AS TotalEnrollment`. Do use table aliases `T1` and `T2` instead of `f` and `s`. Do reference `SUM(T1.\`Enrollment (K-12)\`)` directly in `ORDER BY` instead of using the `TotalEnrollment` alias. Do remove the column alias `AS TotalEnrollment` instead of keeping it. The amended query now correctly orders by the aggregate without selecting it, matching RIGHT_SQL's behavior.




You are a helpful assistant that writes valid SQLite queries.


you will be given database schema, a question related to the database and some amends.
you should generate a SQLite query that solve the question with the help of amends.
the amends contains all the latent mistakes you may make while generating the target sql, you need obey all of them.
you have one function, you have to call it.
function SQLite_receiver takes the final SQLite query you generate.

the database's schema is shown above, now you are required to solve the following question related to the database by generating SQLite query.
the amends contains the latent mistakes you may make, only by avoiding these mistakes can you generate the correct SQLite query.
-- question:Which cities have the top 5 lowest enrollment number for students in grades 1 through 12?
-- amends:
 Do select only `T2.City` instead of `s.City` with `SUM(f."Enrollment (K-12)") AS TotalEnrollment`. Do use table aliases `T1` and `T2` instead of `f` and `s`. Do reference `SUM(T1.\`Enrollment (K-12)\`)` directly in `ORDER BY` instead of using the `TotalEnrollment` alias. Do remove the column alias `AS TotalEnrollment` instead of keeping it. The amended query now correctly orders by the aggregate without selecting it, matching RIGHT_SQL's behavior.
